color:#222222;background:white'>Linux finally grows up when z/OS (IBM’s
flagship OS) is merged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>Very few people understand why IBM needs RHEL to be closed
source. IBM’s RHEL closed source announcement is </span>experiencing the
extreme ire of the entire Linux open source community and has gone unnoticed by
the z/OS community. Neither understands the decision for this announcement nor
how both will be greatly affected. Closed source will not force Google, Amazon,
Oracle, Rocky Linux and others to pay for RHEL. Instead, they will easily switch
to another free Linux Distro. Someone will move key RHEL features from the last
open source to a different open source Linux. Why do people believe that IBMs
intent is to boost profits when closed source doesn’t change the RHEL customer
base?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>IBM knows that Linux is a 20<sup>th</sup> century dinosaur
which needs to be rewritten!</span></b> Google has an army of thousands whose
only job is to keep their 5,500,000 Linux servers running. On average, a Google
Linux server computer has 24 cores (never more than 48 cores) which means that
24 computations can occur at the same exact time. An IBM z/OS Sysplex server
computer can have up to 102,400 cores allowing for 102,400 computations at the
same exact time. Google could easily reduce their army to a couple hundred
people by moving to a couple thousand IBM z/OS Sysplex servers. In layman’s
terms, Google has a traffic congestion problem because they use a fleet of cars
when they should use a combination of cars, buses, trucks, planes and trains.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;background:white'><img
width=433 height=289 id="Picture 4"
src="img/ibm_vs_google.jpg"></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without IBM z/OS technologies in RHEL, RHEL must be run as
virtualized RHEL servers on IBM z computers using VM or LPAR. There is no benefit
for google to run 5,500,000 virtual Linux servers on a couple thousand IBM z
systems versus 5,500,000 cheaper real computers. Linux without z/OS technologies
still requires the same Army.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>IBM needs a Linux designed for the 21<sup>st</sup> century
that runs efficiently on the most advanced computers in the world.</span></b> Although
IBM z/OS is the most advanced OS in the world, companies refuse to buy z/OS
because Linux is free. If the mountain won't come to Muhammad, then Muhammad
must go to the mountain. Linux is currently a jack of all trades but master of
none. You can run it on any computer but that doesn’t mean it runs well. IBM is
looking at implementing z/OS technologies in Linux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>IBM’s closed source policy has made huge design contributions
to the Open Source community.</span></b>  Anyone can write code. The biggest
flaw with open source is the lack of expert design skills. Google’s 5,500,000
Linux servers demonstrates’ how the lack of expert design skills has impacted
Linux. If coders had replicated some of IBM’s z/OS efficiencies technologies,
we would see Linux running efficiently on computers with more than 100,000 cores.
Where would Linux be if DARPA hadn’t designed the internet? It’s very unlikely
the coders of open source TCP/IP (Internet) had the design skills to create it
from scratch. All the open source coding contributions are insignificant compared
to IBM’s expert software technology design contributions (for example: Virtualization
(VM, LPAR, VMWare, Virtualbox), Databases, SQL, High Availability, The Cloud,
Big Data, HTML and much more). Without the existence of these designs, open
source coders would have failed in creating the Linux they love so much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>Closed source is required for IBM to merge z/OS technologies
into Linux.</span></b>  IBM is about to move lucrative z/OS technologies to
Linux. 70% of the Fortune 500 companies buy z/OS because Linux isn’t capable of
providing these critical capabilities. If this move is successful, IBM will
have destroyed their z/OS, z/VSE and z/VM customer base thus costing them $
billions every year. Open source would cause IBM to expose trade secrets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>Businesses choose RHEL but not from RHEL.</span></b> <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyADkmRVe0U">The Linux Tier List -
YouTube</a> is a decent ranking of the more than 40 Linux distro’s. A small
minority of businesses use SUSE Linux ($650 million in revenues). The vast
majority use an RHEL clone (Oracle Linux, Rocky Linux, Alma Linux and RHEL). Even
before IBM bought RHEL, RHEL was considered the devil, much like IBM. For
instance, Google 2022 revenues were $283 billion but they paid RHEL $0.
Instead, they paid Rocky Linux which they installed on many of their 5,500,000
servers. It’s more likely that Google will install SUSE Linux instead of IBM’s
RHEL. Even Amazon Linux is based on RHEL.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>IBM (International Business Machines).</span></b> Of all the
computer companies, IBM represents business needs above all. IBM has the only
computers with zero down time which is why they call it “IBM System z”. IBM has
the only computers with more than 100 cores thus allowing businesses to have 1
server instead of a server farm with a cast of thousands. IBM has the only
computers that are run by business needs instead of by people more knowledgeable
about computers than the business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#222222;
background:white'>False speculation about IBM buying RHEL.</span></b> It’s a small
possibility that IBM wants to force companies to pay for REHL but that doesn’t
make sense because they are more likely to lose customers. Until RHEL went
closed source, it made no sense why IBM bought RHEL in 2019. In my opinion, IBM
wants to stop discounting hardware for Linux and JAVA. But charging full price
will require extra value which in my opinion will be to migrate z/OS technologies
into Linux and create a Linux Sysplex. For more than 20 years, IBM partnered
with RHEL for IBM z computers. In my opinion, they didn’t buy RHEL for its
small revenue stream that is &lt;5% and certainly not to retain open source
customer base. </p>
