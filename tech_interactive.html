<h1 class="pageTitle">(formerly The Tech Museum of Innovation)</h1>

<p>These are the projects where I made a major impact to the exhibits success.
    The biggest impediment in these projects is in dealing with the politics.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Solve the fall:</span>
    After others failed to take the exhitbit from prototype to functional exhibit,
    I successfully rescued the project by making it a functional exhibit.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Jet pack simulator:</span>
    Far too loud since it was introduced several years ago.
    Attempts have been made to reduce the volume. I provided the solution to
    significantly reduce the volume (replace each thruster with 2 smaller thrusters).</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Buster the robot:</span>
    A poor implementation made it difficult to operate.
    Without any down time, I redesigned it with an embedded system and controllers. This eliminated
    the constant stall every few feet and eliminated the TV remote which
    must be within 15 feet and pointed directly at the head.
    It is now operated using a tablet.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Spidy hexapod:</span>
    The museum had a hexapod frame that was assembled but never completed.
    I used the same embedded system and controllers to make it functional.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Earthquake simulator:</span>
    After finding metal shavings and broken handrails, I diagnosed the problem
    was missing bolts from platform mounts causing it to slam into wall.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Earthquake simulator:</span>
    Handrail padding continually tearing appart. Locate ballistic material
    to cover the padding to create a permanent solution.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Social robots:</span>
    After others failed to diagnose failing battery chargers,
    I successfully identified those that were failing.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Social robots:</span>
    Others failed to notice the appearance and state of the robot bases.
    Not only did I make them presentable in a very short amount of time,
    I repaired various problems (e.g. wheels not rolling).</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Jet pack simulator:</span>
    Eliminated the need to wax the floor every week to reduce friction.
    Cleaning the chair pads eliminated the problem and the weekly maintenance.</p>

<p><span class="highlight">Astronaut suit:</span>
    Elminated the need to change ceiling lights every 6 months by installing
    Led's directly into the display. Led's are still functioning after 3 years.</p>
