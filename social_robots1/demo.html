    <p>These are proof of concept examples that need to be finished and prettified. Since the code size is less than 10%
        of the original, it should be easy to complete.</p>
    <p>The big advantage is this has been greatly simplified and will allow you to participate in more
        of the process.</p>

    <p>These screens can be used as training kiosks. Cyber Secuity leverages this concept in
        8 stations. It's sad they made something so easy to create, look so difficult.

    <p>Social robot Labs are great but can't we do better than 16 guests per hour.
    Staff interaction is great but it can be greatly enhanced.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Flex labs - smaller groups that don't aren't fixed to a specific time.</li>
        <li>Basic training thru training kiosks.</li>
        <li>Staff - discuss design and ask reinforcement questions.</li>
        <li>Volunteer participation.</li>
        <li>Worst case, staff still deals with 16 guests per hour and additional guests use training kiosks only.</li>

    <p>In addition to the pre-built SR robot for brain blocks, a couple of real type robots could
        be included. This would add flexibility to the brain block tables and let guests
        experiment with real world examples.

    <h4>Let's go global, extend access & museum's for all</h4>

    School groups get 4 hours minus Imax, lunch, breaks and waiting (around 2 hours).
    The Tech Interactive also wants to make a global impact. Here are some easy and
    inexpensive ways to greatly increase value and impact.

    <ul>
        <li>After hours access thru the web.</li>
        <li>Training mentioned above is web enabled and could be opened to the world.</li>
        <li>Brain block mentioned above is web enabled.
            Add a web camera for pre-built robots to allow visitors to run their programs.</li>
        <li>At school training could prepare school groups before they come to the Tech.</li>
        <li>Web activities could reinforce school groups learning after visiting the museum.</li>
    </ul>
