    <h4>Let's go global, extend access & museum's for all</h4>

    School groups get 4 hours minus Imax, lunch, breaks and waiting (around 2 hours).
    The Tech Interactive also wants to make a global impact. Here are some easy and
    inexpensive ways to greatly increase value and impact.

    <ul>
        <li>After hours access thru the web.</li>
        <li>Training mentioned above is web enabled and could be opened to the world.</li>
        <li>Brain block mentioned above is web enabled.
            Add a web camera for pre-built robots to allow visitors to run their programs.</li>
        <li>At school training could prepare school groups before they come to the Tech.</li>
        <li>Web activities could reinforce school groups learning after visiting the museum.</li>

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What is a servo?
        <answer> Part of a computer</answer>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <answer> a type of car</answer>
        <answer correct> a type of electric motor</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <H4>Correct, it's a type of electric motor.</H4>

        All electric motors can rotate in one direction at a specific speed but there are electric motors that are more
        flexible. Some examples: servo, stepper, linear, direct drive and actuator. <br/>

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What is special about a servo motor?
        <answer>Nothing special</answer>
        <answer>Rotates to a position</answer>
        <answer correct>Rotates to a position and holds that position</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <h4>Correct, it rotates to a specified position and stays in that position.</H4>

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What is the difference between a 180 servo, 360 servo, 520 servo and continuous servo?
        <answer>Size of the motor</answer>
        <answer>Number of gears in the servo</answer>
        <answer correct>The maximum angle the servo will rotate</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <h4>Correct, The number represents the maximum angle the motor can rotate. </h4>

        A 180 servo can rotate
        180 degrees (half circle) and a 360 servo can rotate 360 degree's (full circle). The exception
        is a continuous servo which rotates continuously instead of stopping. Instead of specifying a position,
        you specify the speed and direction.

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What is the special meaning when number 0 is sent to a servo?
        <answer>The position on the servo</answer>
        <answer>Angle</answer>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <answer correct>Power off the servo</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <h4>Correct. Number 0 turns the power off to the servo.</h4>

        When the power is off, you can turn the servo by hand.

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What do numbers 1000 to 2000 represent?
        <answer>Nothing special</answer>
        <answer>An angle</answer>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <answer correct>A position within the servo's range</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <h4>Correct, a number from 1000 to 2000 is a position within the servo's angle range.</h4>

        <span>Most but not all servo's follow a standard where 1000 is the 0 degree position and 2000 the
            angle mentioned on the servo. E.g. a 180 servo, 2000 is the 180 degree position.</span>

        <span>Formula to calculate number from angle: 1000 / servo angle * desired angle + 1000. E.g. position
            a 360 servo at 90 degree's: 1000/360*90+1000 = 1250.</span>

        <video name="images/training_servo_1.mp4"></video>

        <question>What happens if you specify a number between 1 and 999 or a number greater than 2000?
        <answer>The servo assumes 0</answer>
        <answer>The servo assumes 1000 or 2000</answer>
        <answer correct>The servo might break</answer>
        </question>
    </template>

    <template name="screen">
        <h4>Correct, From 1 to 999 or above 2000 could break the servo.</h4>

        Many servo's will allow these numbers even though they will break the servo. In most cases, 990 to 2010
        will be ok. Using 500 or 2500 should be avoided.

        <H1>Congradulations. You have mastered the basics of servo's.</H1>
