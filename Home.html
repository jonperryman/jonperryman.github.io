<h1 class="pageTitle">Developer of exceptional software</h1>

<p> Being in the top 10%, I create extraordinary and elegant solutions that others overlook.
    I am able to solve the tough problems.
    The links above and the teaser's below highlight my diverse skillset.</p>

<h2>Fundamental problem with C, C++ and Go</h2>

<p> Developers need a simple method to customize languages without modifying the compiler source.
    Click <u onclick="loadPageData.call(this);" style="background-color: lightblue; color: black;">C, C++, Go</u>
    for details about how a compiler change would revolutionize C, C++ and Go.</p>

<code _title="Most languages force bad solutions like this">
    printf("%i %hi %li %u %hu %lu", a, b, c, d, e, f)
</code>

<p> Help us to help ourselves. We need flexibility in the languages that allows
    us to avoid solutions that are not optimal.</p>

<code _title="Let developers simplify and create efficient code">
    printf("%i %i %i %i %i %i", a, b, c, d, e, f)
</code>

<h2>Recognizing real problems</h2>

<code _title="Why Arduino Serial.print() and Serial.write() are slow">
    size_t HardwareSerial::write(uint8_t c {
        // If the buffer and the data register is empty, just write the byte
        // to the data register and be done. This shortcut helps
        // significantly improve the effective data rate at high (>
        // 500kbit/s) bitrates, where interrupt overhead becomes a slowdown.
</code>

<p>From the comments of this fix, the developer thinks the problem is solved.
    All Serial print and writes call this function to buffer each byte.
    The correct solution is to buffer multiple bytes.
    After correcting the bug, Serial.write() for 60 bytes is 9 times
    faster (800 instructions versus 7200).</p>

<h2>Simple solutions often go overlooked</h2>

<p>Code boxes are useful to demonstrate code samples</p>

<code _title="This is a sample code box">
    text += cars[0] + "<br>";
    text += cars[1] + "<br>";
    text += cars[2] + "<br>";
    text += cars[3] + "<br>";

    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
        text += cars[i] + "<br>";
    }
</code>

<p>For most developers, reformatting and keeping these up to date is very time consuming.
    Using W3schools solution as an example because they have code boxes in the thousands
    and specialize in teaching HTML, javascript and CSS.</p>

<code _title="w3schools.com hand written HTML for code snippet display">
    <div class="w3-example">
        <h3>code snippet title</h3>
        <div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
            text += cars[0] + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br>text += cars[1] + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br> 
            text += cars[2] + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br>text += cars[3] + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;; 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="w3-code notranslate jsHigh">
            var i;<br>for (i = 0; i &lt; cars.length; i++) 
                { <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text += cars[i] + &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;<br> }
        </div>
    </div> 
</code>

<p>My solution greatly simplifies creating and maintaining code boxes.</p>

<code _title="my hand written HTML for the same code display">
    <code _title="code snippet title">
        text += cars[0] + "<br>";
        text += cars[1] + "<br>";
        text += cars[2] + "<br>";
        text += cars[3] + "<br>";

        var i;
        for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
            text += cars[i] + "<br>";
        }
