<h1 class="pageTitle">Modernizing Go, C and C++</h1>

<p>All languages have weaknesses. Undoubtedly, HTML is one of the weakest but it's functionality is growing
    at phenomenal rate. More important, it is the functionality that developer's want. E.g. Animation is
    now available in CSS because developers built it originally using javascript.
</p>

<p>Are language developers (C, C++ and Go) delivering a great product?
    As designers of the language, their built-in functions will highlight the strength of the language.

<code _title="Printf in C and C++">
    printf("%s %i %hi %li %u %hu %lu", a, b, c, d, e, f, g);

<p>The C and C++ language developers haven't fixed this in 60 years.

    This limitation forces developers into creating this

<code _title="Printf in Go is better">
    printf("%v %v %v %v %v %v %v", a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
</code>

<p>Go improved on printf( ) by eliminating the data type from the formatting string. Sadly the formatting string
    is still parsed every time printf( ) is called.

<p>New software technologies (e.g. AI, neural nets, big data, cloud and ...) are very demanding
    and complex. We need C, C++ and Go to step up to the next level. We need these languages to
    to reduce complexity in solving modern problems. We need these languages to be flexible so
    that we can identify their shortcomings and fix them in a timely manner.</p>

<h2>Fundamental problem: most languages are not user extendable</h2>

<p>HTML is a rigid language (Like C, C++ and Go) but it has grown at an unbelievable rate.
    Netscape did a wonderful thing when they introduced javascript to make HTML user extendable.
    User's could create extremely useful HTML features.
    The language developers see the features that user's truly needed and how user's
    wanted to use those features. </p>

<h1>Solution: compile time language for C, C++ and Go</h1>

<p>I've prototyped this with Go using python as it's compile time language. Unlike a pre-processor,
    it allows users the ability </p>

<p>A compile time language is only viable if the language developers commit to it
    as part of the language specification (not a pre-processor. I've looked at the code and integrating
    python (or another language would not be difficult).</p>

<p>HL Assembler includes a compile time language. I can tell you from real experience
    that you can achieve unbelievable results. In fact, I was able to implement several
    C / C++ features.</p>

<code _title="Valid for C but not HL Assembler">
    a=10+(a+b)*c/(d%e)
</code>

<p>What other language can make valid syntax from invalid syntax? It's not even possible in javascript.</p>

<h1>Actual examples: Doing the impossible in C, C++ and Go</h1>

<p>Don't fret if you don't like the syntax in these examples because this is how I chose to convey
    the information. You could just as easily use a completely different syntax or implementation.</p>
