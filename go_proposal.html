<h3>Would you consider yourself a novice, intermediate, or experienced Go programmer?</h3>
Intermediate.

<h3>What other languages do you have experience with?</h3>
C, C++, Assembler, Python, SAS, JavaScript, PHP, HTML/CSS and more.

<h3>Would this change make Go easier or harder to learn, and why?</h3>
Advanced API's and frameworks can be made trivial to use.
E.g. Messages should be multi-lingual but it's so difficult that even the GO compiler does not offer this capability.
Look at the example below to see how this feature makes it trivial where all products could easily become multi-lingual.

<h3>Has this idea, or one like it, been proposed before?</h3>

<p>Don't confuse this with C macro's nor code generators.
    Nor is this an alternative for functions.
    Instead, this provides control and flexibility at compile time that would normally require
    GO compiler source changes. As part of the compiler, it has some basic knowledge (e.g. making reflection available
    at compile time).
</p>

<h3>Who does this proposal help, and why?</h3>

<p>Everyone, from beginners to the compiler developer's will greatly benefit from this feature. Some of the benefits are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ability to develop elegant solutions to problems not easily solved with the current compiler.</li>
    <li>Improve performance by reducing the impact of worst case scenario solutions.</li>
    <li>Greatly simplify API usage and add validity checking for API's.</li>
    <li>Ability to write compile time algorithms instead of run time algorithms (e.g. reflection).</li>
    <li>Greatly reduce repetitive code.</li>
    <li>Avoid the need for creating gofix code when their API's change.</li>
    <li>Ability to include more resources in the source that are externalized now.</li>
    <li>Go language developers, can see the type of functionality developers really need.</li>
    <li>Potential circumvention to compiler bugs or deficiencies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the proposed change?</h3>

<p> An integrated compile time language for GO that everyone can use. It will provide the ability
    to create compile time logic. It provides access to reflection at compile time, insertion of GO
    code and issue compile time error messages. The compile time language needs to be determined.
    GO would be nice because it would be consistent syntax and run efficiently but compile time programs must be
    compiled before compiling programs that use them along with dynamically loading / calling these programs.
    A language like Python might be more suitable because it is intepreted at runtime but
    it's drawbacks are another programming language and high overhead.
</p>

<h3>Demonstrating the importance of this functionality thru the UI.</h3>

<p>I have real experience with the integrated compile time language that is built into the High Level Assembler.
    There are many real use cases so I will only comment about a few. I'll start with messages.
</p>

<table style="background-color: lightblue; color: black;">

<tr style="background-color:blue; color:white;"><td><h3>Easy to maintain call for a multi-lingual message</h3></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>
Msg( msgId=cs00001, myVar1, myVar2)  // Display message cs0001 is the user's language
</pre></td></tr>

<tr><td><pre>
Msg( msgId=cs0001, msgLevel=error, type=define,
    msg='Message %v not displayed because message module %v was not found',
    help={
        ::Explanation:
            Message "v1" was not displayed because the message module "v2" was not found.
        ::System action:
            The message is not displayed.
        ::Corrective action:
            Look at the help text for the original message to determine if you need to take
            an action for that message. To resolve this bug, search the problem database for the
            appropriate action to resolve the problem.
    }
)
</pre></td></tr>
</table>

<p> Why are most messages in english instead of being multi-lingual? Why don't messages have help text?
    Where are the advanced message features?
</p>

<p> The simple answer is GO and C are not convenient, efficient nor easy in solving many problems.
    We must settle for mediocre solutions such as "gettext( )" that are high runtime overhead with a new language
    to learn. Worse yet, you must understand the impact of changing the gettext message id.
</p>

<p>The example above was taken from my product written in High Level Assembler but changed to
    be compatible with GO syntax. This solution suited my needs but could easily be changed to be more flexible.
    The message definition is from one of the english language message modules so that the documentation writers
    can easily fix problems.
    The help text explains the message and guides users thru problem resolution. The message ID
    crucial to identify the message regardless of user language. Equally important is that automation deals
    with the correct message. Customer's can easily identify automation changes when
    a message changes syntax. The error level ensures the return code is set correctly.

</table>

<p> This is the actual strings.IndexAny( ) code in GO.
    Whether you code IndexAny( ) in GO or C, this logic is the best you can do
    because there is not any compile time flexibility built into the language.
    An integrated compile time language allows you to create very robust solution.
    In this case, there are 3 compile time scenarios that must be considered to cover all situations.
</p>

<h4>Scenario 1: quoted search characters: strings.IndexAny( myString, "&lt;&gt;&amp;&semi;" )</h4>

<p>The current implementation results in unnecessary runtime overhead that could be performed at compile time.
    The double FOR loop results in 4 times the execution time in this example.
    Using makeASCIISet( ) is a run time solution that occurs with every call to IndexAny.
    The correct solution would be to create the ascii table at compile time (asciTable :=
    [256]byte{ '&lt;' : 1, '&gt;' : 1, '&amp;' : 1, '&semi;' : 1 } but that's expecting too much from the developer.
</p>

<p>With this new functionality, creating the asciiTable statement is a simple loop thru the search characters.
    Non-ascii unicode characters can generate an additional search for those characters.
    Beginners don't notice any difference.
</p>

<h4> Scenario 2: search characters in a variable: strings.IndexAny( myString, searchCharactersVariable )</h4>

<p>The standard implementation is the current implementation. It does not do any compile time optimization.
    This is easy for beginners because they don't notice any difference.
</p>

<h4> Scenario 3: advanced search optimization features</h4>
<p> For ease of use, beginners can ignore advanced features.
    In fact, these features are only needed in extreme cases (e.g. large amounts of data fewer
    than 8 search characters). This could be something as simple as a pre-allocated ascii buffer / search
    structure. Using this feature could be keyword parameters or different call types.
    Implementation is truly up to the developer of this functionality.

    With this feature, we could easily solve these problems.

<p>My XML parser written in High Level Assembler executes in less than half the time it takes in GO.
    The example above is in a GO compatible syntax. Compared with the current syntax, it is much easier
    to comprehend for GO beginners who understand XML. Additionally, the current implementation
    only allows for 1 standard implementation. There are several XML standards and advanced features which would be
    better served using an integrated compile time language. The example above shows multiple
    root elements (person & company) which is not available in the current implementation.

<h3>Please describe as precisely as possible the change to the language.</h3>

<p>The minimum changes to the compiler:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Devise a mechanism to identify these functions to be called (e.g. a new definition statement or maybe use of #).</li>
    <li>During the compile phase that sets data types, call the function that was identified.</li>
    <li>Choose a compile time language. Possibly GO, Python, Java, NodeJS or ???</li>
    <li>Runaway loop timer (user code)</li>
    <li>API's:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete AST's</li>
            <li>Add GO code snippets as AST's.</li>
            <li>Reflection using the AST's prior to the current position</li>
            <li>Notes and errors</li>
            <li>Global variables</li>
        </ul>
</ol>

<p>Advanced features could be discussed later if this is accepted.</p>

<h3>What would change in the [https://golang.org/ref/spec](language spec)?</h3>

The only change is a new section to cover the integrated compile time language.

<h3>Please also describe the change informally, as in a class teaching Go.</h3>

To be written if this feature is to be implemented. Because of the impact, this feature will be large.

<h3>Is this change backward compatible?</h3>

Yes.

<h3>Breaking the Go 1 compatibility guarantee is a large cost and requires a large benefit.</h3>

Go 1 compatibility is not affected by this change.

<h3>Show example code before and after the change.</h3>

See above.

<h3>What is the cost of this proposal? (Every language change has a cost).</h3>

TBD.

<h3>How many tools (such as vet, gopls, gofmt, goimports, etc.) would be affected?</h3>

<p> Some generated code may not be available to the tools which may cause false errors such as missing variables.
    Otherwise, keeping the UI syntax consistent with GO should allow most tools to function correctly.
</p>

<h3>What is the compile time cost?</h3>

<p> Use of this feature will increase compile time which could be significant depending upon implementation and
    compile time programs written. This can only be determined during the design phase.
</p>

<h3>What is the run time cost?</h3>

Run time will never increase. In some cases, run time will decrease.

<h3>Can you describe a possible implementation?</h3>


<h3>Do you have a prototype? (This is not required.)</h3>

Some UI prototypes are above. Called function would depend upon language chosen.

<h3>How would the language spec change?</h3>

Addtion to the language spec.

<h3>Orthogonality: how does this change interact or overlap with existing features?</h3>

Not applicable.

<h3>Is the goal of this change a performance improvement?</h3>

No, but that is one of the side benefits.

<h3>If so, what quantifiable improvement should we expect?</h3>

<h3>How would we measure it?</h3>

<h3>Does this affect error handling?</h3>

No.

<h3>If so, how does this differ from previous error handling proposals?</h3>

<h3>Is this about generics?</h3>

<p> While not specifically about generics, it solves the basic complaint (repetitive coding).
    You only need look at messages to see how great opportunities are missed because of compiler limitations.
    When will the compiler have multi-lingual messages? When will the co,piler have help text for messages.
</p>

<h3>If so, how does this differ from the the current design draft and the previous generics proposals?</h3>

Compile time language is about making code much more readable, efficient, robust and maintainable.
It can greatly simplify many complex problems. Let's assume the meta language is GO so
that it's simple for everyone to use. Let's assume that #xxxx( ) calls this go function and passes the
parsed data between the parenthesis. The only thing to learn is calling the compiler API's such as
inserting code and using compile time reflection.

Go generate or writting a pre-processor are a waste of time in resolving many problems. If they worked well for
compile time logic, then how would you propose fixing the CPU overhead in the compiler.

This feature does not change the GO language. It just allows insertion of GO code.
Most meta language programs won't be more than a hundred lines.
Of all the concerns, "abuse" is the only legitimate concern but that is true with other
features (solved using standards and best practices).

If you doubt this works, then ask yourself why the CPU overhead in scanner.go
has never been addressed. The answer is it's painful without compile time logic.
E.g. the following is code from func scanComment() processing for // comments:

<pre>
s.next() // ignore the //
for s.ch != '\n' && s.ch >= 0 {
    if s.ch == '\r' {
        numCR++
    }
    s.next()
}
</pre>

CPU usage could be reduced by over 50% (as much as 90%) for parsing but do you want to code it correctly
when it looks so nasty? Do you want to repeat this everywhere this everywhere it occurs?

<pre>
s.next() // ignore the //
for s.findNext( &[256]byte{0:1, '\n':1, '\r':1, 128:1, --- repeat to 255 --- } ) && s.ch != '\n' {
    if s.ch == '\r' {
        numCR++
    }
}
</pre>

With compile time language, this would look like:

<pre>
s.next() // ignore the //
for s.#findNext( "\u0000\r\n" ) && s.ch != '\n' {
    if s.ch == '\r' {
        numCR++
    }
}
</pre>

#findNext( ) is the compile time function which is passed positional arg 1 "\u0000\r\n" and no keyword parms.
It produces the findNext call that you would have coded by hand.

<pre>
func #findNext(args) {
    goCode = "findNext( &[256]byte{ "
    for i:=0; i<len(args.1); {
        r, w = utf8.DecodeRune(s.src[s.rdOffset:])
        if r == utf8.RuneError && w == 1 {
            error("illegal UTF-8 encoding")
        } else {
            goCode += " " + args.1[i] + ":1, "
        }
        i += w
    }
    goCode += "})"
    ast.insert(*,goCode)
}
</pre>



#findNext adds a runtime call to Func findNext( ) which is a slightly modified version of the func next( ) from scanner.go.
Replace the function prototype. A return true is needed where a character is found and return false when EOF is reached.
The CPU reduction comes from the for loop skipping characters that are not used.

<pre>
func (s *Scanner) findNext(charTable [256]byte) {
    for ; s.rdOffset < len(s.src) && charTable[s.src[s.rdOffset]] == 0; s.rdOffset++ {
}
</pre>

This feature offers great benefits to all GO developers with a minor amount of work. Most developer's do not have
experience with this type of feature. It's true value should not be underestimated.

==============================================================================================================

Languages such as Go and C strongly encourage a byte processing mentality. C get's around some of this inefficiency by providing multi-byte functions (e.g. memcmp, strcmp, memcpy, strcpy). It does not provide functions such as indexAny() because it is very inefficient without a compile time language. 

You can do bandaid fixes to make scanner.go faster but to make it a speed demon, you will need a different mindset and do a rewrite. To make this easy to understand, lets discuss the small piece of code from scanComment that searches for \n as the end of the // comment.

<pre>
for s.ch != '\n' && s.ch >= 0 {                                   <===
    if s.ch == '\r' {                                             <===
        numCR++
    }
    s.next()                                                      <===
}

func (s *Scanner) next() {
	if s.rdOffset < len(s.src) {
		s.offset = s.rdOffset                                     <===
		if s.ch == '\n' {                                         <===
			s.lineOffset = s.offset
			s.file.AddLine(s.offset)
		}
		r, w := rune(s.src[s.rdOffset]), 1                        <===
		switch {
		case r == 0:                                              <===
			s.error(s.offset, "illegal character NUL")
		case r >= utf8.RuneSelf:                                  <===
			// not ASCII
			r, w = utf8.DecodeRune(s.src[s.rdOffset:])
			if r == utf8.RuneError && w == 1 {
				s.error(s.offset, "illegal UTF-8 encoding")
			} else if r == bom && s.offset > 0 {
				s.error(s.offset, "illegal byte order mark")
			}
		}
		s.rdOffset += w                                          <===
		s.ch = r                                                 <===
	} else {
		s.offset = len(s.src)
		if s.ch == '\n' {
			s.lineOffset = s.offset
			s.file.AddLine(s.offset)
		}
		s.ch = -1 // eof
	}
}
</pre>

Notice the statements with "<===" that are executed for each character. These statements don't do anything useful except for /r, /n, 0 and all runes because they are more than 1 byte. To efficiently execute these statements only for those characters, we need to pass a character translation array with the characters of interest on the next( ) function call.

<pre>
s.next( &[256]byte{0:1, '\n':1, '\r':1, 128:1, --- repeat to 255 --- } )
</pre>

This is a constant array that must be passed by reference (&) so avoid the overhead of copying the array at each call to next(). The array size must be 256 because a character value can be 0 to 255. We index into this array using each value of each character in the src. Each value in the array defaults to 0 and 0, \n and \r are set to a value of 1 (translation value).
In addition, each rune start byte (128 to 255) is set to a value of 1 (translation value).

<pre>
func (s *Scanner) next(translationTable *[256]byte) {
    for ; s.rdOffset < len(s.src) && translationTable[s.src[s.rdOffset]] == 0; s.rdOffset++ {
    }
</pre>

The next( ) function is modified to accept the translation table by reference from the caller. A tight "for loop" loop through the source until there's no more data or the translation value is not 0 (found a character of interest). The compiler should optimize the "for loop" to be very fast because it's so small.

UTF8 is designed to be fast by having all bytes of a rune look like a rune (>127). Since comments are not interested in rune characters, they actually don't need to be included in translation table unless you want rune validation which probably isn't important.

As for other parts of scanner.go, they need the same changes but are convoluted. They should be made readable for clarity and maintenance.

To further improve maintainability and reduce CPU, the GOTO statement should be modified to allow GOTO DEPENDING ON where it supports multiple labels and the label is selected using a variable that contains an index. By specifying the index to a label for each character used in the translation table, you avoid the overhead for IF and CASE statements. The maintainability is improved by reducing repetition.

Also note that other modules need these changes (e.g. xml and json parsing).

=======================================================================================================



An important proposal will fail without your support

This proposal will be a huge benefit to everyone. Are writing pre-processors and GO generate truly meeting our needs? Is the extra implementation work worth the effort. Do you wish for compile time logic? Proposal https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37292 will fail if it does not get some "likes". Remember, this is a loosly formulated proposal and not a design document.

There are many examples where compile time flexibity is important. Consider the current mindset's effect on GNU GETTEXT( ):

GETTEXT( ) is very important - native language support (multi-lingual messages and localization)
Hundreds of developer's involved in design and Implementation. This is their best implementation.
Documentation is 17 chapters -> https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
Big-o time complexity o(n^2)
Several utilities for maintaining catalogs.
Use and maintenance is labor intensive and time consuming.

You have difficult decisions and lots of work early in your project with this implementation.

fmt.Println( gettext( fmt.Sprintf"message text at %v with %v bytes", time.format( ), number) ) )

This is the current implementation where gettext is a function call with the message to be translated. The message must be contain everything to be translated. After determining the language and localization, gettext searches for a matching message translation rule in the language specific catalog. The rule is applied to the message and data needing localization is converted (e.g. dates, numbers, currency).

#gettext( "message text at %t with %n bytes", time, number )
    or
#gettext( msgid="jon001", time, number )

Users should find this much easier to code and the big-o time complexity is o(n)!

The gettext product developer will create the #gettext() function which is invisible to the users. One possible implementation for #gettext with my proposal gives you lots of flexibility and eliminates 90% of the code in the real GNU gettext( ). The compiler would call the following function:

func #gettext( args Args ) {
    src := "gettext("         // call real gettext function
    current_positional_arg := 1
    if args.msgid != nil {    // keyword argument "msgid" not specified
        src += args.msgid + " ,nil"
    } else {
        src += "nil, " + args.positional[1]
        current_positional_arg := 2
    }
    for ; current_positional_arg <= args.positional.length; current_positional_arg {
        arg = args.positional[current_positional_arg]
        if reflect.TypeOf(arg) == "time.Time" {
            src += ",gettext.TimeLocal(" + arg + ")"
        } else if reflect.TypeOf(arg) == "int" {
            src += ",gettext.Number(" + arg + ")"
        } else {
            src += "," + arg
        }
    }
    compiler.AddStatement(*,src)   // replaces the #gettext( ) with the new source code

This compiler called function replaces the #gettext( ... ):

#gettext(msgid="jon001", number, time)
    would be replaced with
gettext("jon001", nil, gettext.Number(number), gettext.TimeLocal(time) )

The real gettext( ) is greatly simplified. Messages are now in a GO module instead of searching a specialized catalog. There would be several language specific message modules that are dynamically loaded as needed. E.g. en_jon.go where en is an english message module and jon is the first part of the message id (e.g. jon001). The message rule for the last 3 characters is returned. Gettext( ) uses this rule to translate the message.

Since the language specific message modules are editted by translators instead of programmers, it needs to be similar to the GNU standard while having GO syntax.

#msg( language=en, prefix=jon )   // english messages jon###

//  translator-comments
//  extracted-comments
// reference…
// flag…
#msg(
    id=001,                   // msg id jon001
    msgstr[0]="message text at %t with %n bytes",
    ...
    msgstr[N]="message text at %t with %n bytes"
)

//  translator-comments
//  extracted-comments
// reference…
// flag…
#msg(
    id=002,
    msgstr[0]="message text at %t with %n bytes",
    ...
    msgstr[N]="message text at %t with %n bytes"
)

//  translator-comments
//  extracted-comments
// reference…
// flag…
#msg(
    id=002,
    msgstr[0]="message text at %t with %n bytes",
    ...
    msgstr[N]="message text at %t with %n bytes"
)

A compile time language has many more benefits that are not obvious. I strongly urge everyone to vote on proposal https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37292 .
