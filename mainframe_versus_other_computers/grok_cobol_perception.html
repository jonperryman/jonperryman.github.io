<h1>I asked X Grok (AI) "What is the current perception of Cobol?"<br/>
    I was horrified by lies people believe</h1>

<p>The current perception of COBOL in 2025 is a mix of respect, nostalgia, and a bit of frustration, shaped by its enduring presence and its quirks. It’s seen as a legacy language—vital yet dated. Many in the tech world acknowledge its reliability and the sheer volume of critical systems it still underpins, like banking, insurance, and government operations. Industry reports (like those from IBM and Micro Focus) often highlight that billions of lines of COBOL code remain in use, handling an estimated 70-80% of global financial transactions. This gives it a reputation as the "unsung hero" of the business world—quietly keeping the lights on while newer languages get the spotlight.</p>

<p>Among developers, though, COBOL’s perception is less glowing. It’s often viewed as clunky and verbose, a relic from a bygone era when readability for non-coders trumped efficiency or elegance. The syntax—think "ADD A TO B GIVING C"—feels archaic compared to modern languages like Python or Go. Younger programmers, especially those trained on agile, web-focused stacks, tend to see it as a dinosaur, hard to learn and harder to love. Job boards and developer forums (like Stack Overflow or Reddit’s r/programming) show COBOL skills in demand but niche, often tied to maintaining old systems rather than building anew. This leads to a perception of it as a "career dead end" for some, though others see it as a lucrative specialty—COBOL coders can command high salaries due to scarcity, with some reports citing rates 20-30% above average for legacy system experts.</p>

<p>Public perception got a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic around 2020, when states like New Jersey and Kansas publicly begged for COBOL programmers to fix unemployment systems. That moment spotlighted its resilience but also its fragility—too many organizations rely on it, yet too few know it. In 2025, this duality persists: COBOL is respected for its staying power but criticized for holding back modernization. Companies are torn between rewriting systems in newer languages (a costly, risky move) or sticking with COBOL (safe but stagnant). Tools like Micro Focus’s Visual COBOL or cloud integrations try to keep it relevant, but the vibe is still "old faithful" meets "please retire already."</p>

<p>What’s your take—are you asking because you’re curious about its role today or thinking of diving into it yourself?</p>
