<h2>I asked ChatGPT: "percentage linux servers running on x86"</h2>

<p>As of early 2025, approximately <b>88% of Linux servers run on x86 architecture</b>, encompassing both Intel and AMD processors. This figure reflects x86's longstanding dominance in enterprise and cloud server environments.</p>

<p>However, the landscape is evolving. ARM-based servers are rapidly gaining traction, particularly in hyperscale data centers and AI-focused workloads. ARM Holdings projects that its share of the global data center CPU market will rise to 50% by the end of 2025, up from around 15% in 2024.  Major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure are increasingly adopting ARM-based chips, reflecting this shift. ([Has x86 lost the data center battle?

<p>In summary, while x86 continues to dominate the Linux server market, the adoption of alternative architectures like ARM is accelerating, signaling a significant shift in server infrastructure trends.</p>

<h2>I also asked ChatGPT: "percentage linux servers not running on x86"</h2>

<p>As of 2025, precise data on the percentage of Linux servers not running on x86 architectures is limited. However, x86_64 (64-bit Intel and AMD) remains the dominant architecture for Linux servers. Nonetheless, alternative architectures are gaining traction in specific sectors: ([SupportedArchitectures - Community Help Wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SupportedArchitectures?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>ARM (AArch64)</b>: Increasingly adopted in cloud computing and edge devices due to its energy efficiency.</li>

<li> <b>IBM POWER and IBM Z (s390x)</b>: Utilized in enterprise environments for high-performance computing and mainframe applications.</li>

<li> <b>RISC-V and others</b>: Emerging in specialized applications and research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Major Linux distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Ubuntu, and AlmaLinux support these architectures, reflecting a commitment to multi-architecture compatibility . ([SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Linux_Enterprise?utm_source=chatgpt.com))</p>

<p>While x86_64 continues to dominate, the presence of Linux servers on non-x86 architectures is notable in specific use cases.</p>
