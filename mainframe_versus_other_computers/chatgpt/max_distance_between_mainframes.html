<h2>I asked ChatGPT: "what is the maximum distance between mainframes?"</h2>

<p>There’s no hard limit to the <b>maximum distance between mainframes</b>, because it really depends on <b>what they’re doing and how they’re connected</b>. But here’s the deal:</p>

<h2>🔄 If They’re Part of a Synchronized System:</h2>
<p>When mainframes are working together (like in active-active setups or data mirroring), <b>distance matters because of latency</b>. For real-time synchronization:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Up to 100 km (62 miles)</b> is common for <b>high-speed fiber links</b> with near-instant failover (like IBM’s GDPS systems).</li>

<li> <b>300–500 km (200–300 miles)</b> can work with <b>asynchronous replication</b>, where there's a slight delay in data syncing.</li>

<li> Beyond that, <b>latency increases</b> and real-time syncing becomes impractical, though it's still possible for backups or less time-sensitive tasks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🌍 If They’re Independent or Loosely Coupled:</h2>
<p>If the mainframes aren’t tightly linked — say, one in Tokyo and another in New York — then they can be <b>any distance apart</b>. They might exchange data periodically, but they’re not acting like a single system.</p>

<p>So, the max distance depends on <b>how closely they need to cooperate</b>.</p>

<p>Want a visual showing how distance affects latency in these setups?</p>
