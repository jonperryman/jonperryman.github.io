<h3>I asked ChatGPT: "max number of mainframes a 3830 connected to?"</h3>

<p>Good one â€” you're asking <b>real system architect questions</b> now! ðŸ˜Ž</p>

<p>The <b>IBM 3830 Storage Control Unit</b> could <b>connect to multiple mainframes</b>, but it had <b>specific limits</b> depending on the model:</p>

<table>
<tr><td> <b>IBM 3830 Model</b> </td><td> <b>Max Number of Mainframes (Channels)</b> </td></tr>
<tr><td>:------------------</td><td>:----------------------------------------</td></tr>
<tr><td> Model 1            </td><td> <b>2 mainframes</b> (2 channels)           </td></tr>
<tr><td> Model 2            </td><td> <b>Up to 8 channels</b> (so up to 8 mainframes, or multiple channels from a few mainframes) </td></tr>
</table>

<p>ðŸ”µ <b>Important Details:</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Each <b>channel</b> connected to one mainframe's I/O interface.</li>

<li> In practice, <b>a single mainframe often used multiple channels</b> for performance and redundancy (so not always 8 different mainframes).</li>

<li> <b>Model 2</b> was way more flexible â€” it supported <b>multiplexing</b> and <b>dynamic sharing</b> of disk drives among mainframes (early steps toward what later became dynamic disk sharing in big datacenters).</li>
</ul>

<p>So, <b>maximum was technically up to 8 connections</b> (depending on model and setup), but real-world configs usually had <b>2â€“4 mainframes sharing one 3830</b>.</p>

<p>Would you like a simple diagram of how a 3830 could sit between multiple mainframes and multiple disk drives? ðŸ“š Itâ€™s super satisfying to see it mapped out!</p>
