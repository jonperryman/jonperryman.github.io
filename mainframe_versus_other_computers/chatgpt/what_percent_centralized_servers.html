<h3>I asked ChatGPT: "what percentage of servers are centralized?"</h3>

<p>There isn't a single hard number for the <b>percentage of servers that are centralized</b>, because it depends heavily on how you define <b>"centralized"</b> — but here’s a clear, honest breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Enterprise servers</b> (companies, governments, universities):<br/>
  Over <b>90%</b> are traditionally centralized — meaning they operate from dedicated data centers, server rooms, or private cloud environments controlled by the organization.</li>

<li> <b>Cloud servers</b> (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.):<br/>
  Cloud computing *appears* decentralized to users (because it’s "in the cloud"), but in reality, it's <b>highly centralized</b> inside massive data centers run by a few companies.<br/>
  Today, <b>65–75%</b> of global server workloads are on major cloud platforms, and these are centralized at the infrastructure level.</li>

<li> <b>True decentralized networks</b> (blockchains, peer-to-peer systems like BitTorrent):<br/>
  These make up a <b>tiny fraction</b>, probably <b>less than 1%</b> of all servers worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<b>Realistic estimate</b>:
<p>If you define "centralized" as "controlled from a few physical locations or by a small number of organizations," <b>probably 90–95%</b> of servers are centralized today.</p>

<b>Why so centralized?</b>
<ul>
<li> It's cheaper and easier to maintain big server farms.</li>

<li> Security and compliance are easier with central control.</li>

<li> Performance can be optimized in big data centers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>But</b>: there’s a growing trend toward *decentralized or distributed models* like edge computing, decentralized web (Web3), and blockchain — but these are still small compared to traditional centralized systems.</p>
