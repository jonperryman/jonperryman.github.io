<tr><td> <b>1964</b> </td><td> IBM announces the <b>System/360</b> family, introducing new centralized data communication needs. </td></tr>

<tr><td> <b>1965â€“66</b> </td><td> <b>First deliveries</b> of the IBM 2703 begin, to support S/360 mainframes â€” especially for organizations with many remote terminals and slow lines. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>1967</b> </td><td> IBM expands support â€” the 2703 now handles up to <b>176 low-speed communication lines</b> (e.g., teletypes, punched card devices, simple terminals). </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Late 1960s</b> </td><td> New communication adapters (modems, leased lines) are integrated. IBM gradually improves <b>line speeds and protocol handling</b>. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Early 1970s</b> </td><td> 2703 continues in wide use. <b>Competition increases</b> (e.g., 3rd-party controllers, modems). IBM starts planning for more flexible "front-end processors." </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>1972</b> </td><td> IBM introduces <b>System/370</b> â€” the 2703 remains compatible, but newer communication products (like the <b>3705 Communication Controller</b>) are positioned to eventually replace it. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Midâ€“Late 1970s</b> </td><td> The 2703 is considered "legacy" â€” still heavily deployed but newer systems (especially <b>3705</b> and later <b>3725</b>) take over new installations. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>1977â€“1979</b> </td><td> IBM gradually <b>withdraws the 2703 from marketing</b> for new customers (specific dates varied by region). Still supported for existing users. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Early 1980s</b> </td><td> IBM <b>officially phases out</b> 2703 support in favor of SNA-based communications (SNA = Systems Network Architecture) using newer hardware. </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Mid-1980s</b> </td><td> 2703 machines mostly disappear from production â€” surviving mainly in a few long-running banking, government, and academic setups.</td></tr>

<h2>ðŸ§  <b>What was the IBM 2703?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li> A <b>communications controller</b>:<br/>
    Connected a mainframe to <b>hundreds of slow terminals</b> over serial/modem lines.</li>

<li> Designed for <b>high-volume, low-speed</b> data transmission (e.g., punched card readers, Teletype devices, 2740 terminals).</li>

<li> Supported <b>start-stop</b> transmission, <b>synchronous</b> and <b>asynchronous</b> protocols.</li>

<li> <b>Important</b> in early remote computing â€” letting businesses have <b>terminals all over cities and states</b> tied to a central System/360 or System/370.</li>
</ul>

<h2>âš¡ <b>Technical Highlights</b></h2>
<ul>
<li> Handled <b>up to 176 devices</b> through channel adapters.</li>

<li> Offloaded communication work from the main CPU (early "network offload").</li>

<li> Early designs did <b>not</b> use full SNA; it was more primitive, based on physical and character-level communication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>âœ… <b>Summary</b></h2>
<p>The <b>IBM 2703 Transmission Control</b> was introduced in <b>1965</b>, peaked in the <b>late 1960s</b>, and was gradually replaced in the <b>1970s</b> by more advanced communication controllers.</p>
<p>It played a critical role in early <b>remote computing</b>, especially for businesses that needed <b>hundreds of user terminals</b> connected to their mainframes.</p>
