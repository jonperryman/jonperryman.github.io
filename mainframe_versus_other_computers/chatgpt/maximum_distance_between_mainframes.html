Great question — the short answer is **no**, a **mainframe is not inherently a distributed computer**, but it **can be part of a distributed system**.

### Here's the breakdown:

- **Mainframe**:  
  A **centralized computing system** — everything (processing, storage, management) is tightly integrated in one powerful machine. It’s built for **scalability and reliability**, but all the action happens in one physical system.

- **Distributed computing**:  
  Involves **multiple independent computers** (nodes) working together over a network to solve problems. They often share the workload and may be spread across locations.

### However...
Modern mainframes **can participate in distributed architectures**. For example, they might:

- Communicate with other servers in a cloud environment  
- Run microservices and APIs that interact with distributed apps  
- Use virtualization (like IBM's z/OS with z/VM or LinuxONE) to simulate many systems inside one mainframe  

So while the **core architecture of a mainframe is centralized**, it can **mimic or support distributed computing**.

Want an example of how a mainframe might be part of a hybrid cloud or distributed system?

### good data follows

There’s no hard limit to the **maximum distance between mainframes**, because it really depends on **what they’re doing and how they’re connected**. But here’s the deal:

### 🔄 If They’re Part of a Synchronized System:
When mainframes are working together (like in active-active setups or data mirroring), **distance matters because of latency**. For real-time synchronization:

- **Up to 100 km (62 miles)** is common for **high-speed fiber links** with near-instant failover (like IBM’s GDPS systems).
- **300–500 km (200–300 miles)** can work with **asynchronous replication**, where there's a slight delay in data syncing.
- Beyond that, **latency increases** and real-time syncing becomes impractical, though it's still possible for backups or less time-sensitive tasks.

### 🌍 If They’re Independent or Loosely Coupled:
If the mainframes aren’t tightly linked — say, one in Tokyo and another in New York — then they can be **any distance apart**. They might exchange data periodically, but they’re not acting like a single system.

So, the max distance depends on **how closely they need to cooperate**.
