<h3>I asked ChatGPT to "define specialized computer"</h3>

<p>A <b>specialized computer</b> is a computer system designed and optimized to perform a <b>specific task or a limited range of tasks</b> with high efficiency, accuracy, or speed. Unlike general-purpose computers, which can run a wide variety of applications, specialized computers are <b>tailored for particular functions</b>.</p>

<h3>Key Characteristics of Specialized Computers:</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Task-Specific</b>: Built to do one or a few tasks extremely well (e.g., controlling a carâ€™s braking system or running medical imaging software).</li>

<li> <b>Efficient</b>: Highly optimized for performance, speed, or power consumption in their specific domain.</li>

<li> <b>Limited Flexibility</b>: Not ideal for running unrelated applications or adapting to new tasks without redesign.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples:</h3>
<table>
<tr><td> Device Type              </td><td> Specialized For                          </td></tr>
<tr><td>--------------------------</td><td>-------------------------------------------</td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Embedded systems</b>     </td><td> Control appliances, cars, robots, etc.    </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Game consoles</b>        </td><td> Video gaming                              </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>ATMs</b>                 </td><td> Banking transactions                      </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Routers</b>              </td><td> Network traffic management                </td></tr>
<tr><td> <b>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</b> </td><td> Parallel image rendering & AI tasks     </td></tr>
