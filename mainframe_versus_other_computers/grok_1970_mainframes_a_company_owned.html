<h1>I asked GROK:<br/>
    "How many mainframes did a company own (1970's)?"</h1>

<p>In the 1970s, the number of mainframes owned by a typical company varied widely depending on the company's size, industry, and reliance on computing. Large corporations, especially in finance, insurance, manufacturing, or government sectors, often owned 1 to 5 mainframes to handle data processing, payroll, inventory, and other critical tasks. For example:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">

    <li><b>Large enterprises</b> (e.g., banks, airlines, or Fortune 500 companies) might have had 2–5 mainframes, often IBM System/360 or System/370 models, to manage extensive data and transaction processing across multiple departments or locations.</li>

    <br/><li><b>Mid-sized companies</b> typically owned 1 mainframe, if they could afford one, or relied on time-sharing services from third-party providers.</li>

    <br/><li><b>Smaller businesses</b> rarely owned mainframes due to high costs (hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per unit) and instead used minicomputers or outsourced computing.</li>

</ul>

<p>Mainframes were centralized systems, so even large organizations needed only a few to serve their needs, unlike today’s distributed computing environments. Data is sparse, but IBM dominated the market, and by the mid-1970s, over 10,000 mainframes (mostly IBM’s) were installed worldwide, with large U.S. firms accounting for a significant share.</p>
