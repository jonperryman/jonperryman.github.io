<h2> I asked GROK when was "the mainframe is a Dinosaur" coined?<br/>
     The decay of basic computer software skills began!</h2>

<p>The term "mainframe dinosaur" was coined around the 1980s, when personal computers and client-server systems started gaining popularity, leading some to predict the decline of mainframe computers. The "dinosaur" label reflected the perception that mainframes—large, expensive, and seemingly outdated—were headed for extinction, much like dinosaurs. While no single individual or event is definitively credited with coining the phrase, it emerged in tech discourse as a metaphor for obsolescence.</p>

<p>A notable reference appears in a 2003 article from The Irish Times, which mentions pundits in the 1980s and 1990s calling mainframes dinosaurs as they foresaw their replacement by newer systems. Similarly, a 2004 SFGate article notes the term’s use by critics, quoting a Sun executive calling IBM’s mainframe a "dinosaur" around the time of its 40th anniversary. The term gained traction with IBM’s 2003 release of the z990 mainframe, code-named "T-Rex," a playful nod to the dinosaur metaphor, as IBM’s team chose the name to counter critics who mocked mainframes as relics.</p>

<p>Despite the label, mainframes have persisted, handling critical workloads for banks, airlines, and retailers, proving the "dinosaur" tag more rhetorical than accurate. Exact origins remain anecdotal, tied to the tech industry’s shift toward distributed computing in the late 20th century.</p>
