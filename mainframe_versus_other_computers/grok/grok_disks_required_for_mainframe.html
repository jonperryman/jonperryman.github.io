<h2>I asked the GROK AI <br/>
    "How many disk drives needed for 10 mainframe computers"><<br/>
    10 disk drives is wrong. Only 1 disk drive is required!</h2>

<p>Determining the minimum number of disk drives required for 10 mainframes is more complex than for typical computers, as mainframes are designed for high-performance, large-scale data processing and often have unique storage configurations. However, since the question asks for the minimum, we can focus on the smallest number of disk drives needed for 10 mainframes to function.</p>

<p>A mainframe, like any computing system, requires at least one disk drive to store its operating system, critical software, and data. Unlike modern PCs, mainframes historically used multiple disk drives for redundancy, performance (e.g., via RAID or similar setups), and to handle vast datasets. However, in a theoretical minimum scenario—say, a stripped-down mainframe for basic operation—a single disk drive could suffice per system, assuming it has enough capacity and the mainframe’s architecture supports booting and running from one drive.</p>

<p>Modern mainframes, such as IBM’s zSeries, often connect to external storage systems (like SANs or DASDs) rather than relying solely on internal drives. Even in these cases, the mainframe itself needs at least one accessible disk (or logical volume) to initialize and operate. For simplicity, and focusing strictly on the minimum, we can assume each mainframe requires at least one dedicated disk drive.</p>

<p>Thus, for 10 mainframes, the minimum number of disk drives required would be 10—one per mainframe. This assumes no redundancy, no performance optimization, and the most basic operational setup possible.</p>

<p>Answer: The minimum number of disk drives that 10 mainframes require is 10.</p>
