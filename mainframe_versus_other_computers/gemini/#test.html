<p>While the term "transaction" is heavily associated with mainframe environments due to systems like CICS and IMS, the concept of transactional integrity is also crucial in various software applications running on Linux. However, the implementation details and the scope of what constitutes a "transaction" can differ.</p>

<p>Here are some software examples of transactions in Linux environments, categorized by the type of application:</p>

<h3>1. Database Management Systems (DBMS):</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>MySQL:</b> Uses the concept of transactions to ensure ACID properties for data modifications. You can start a transaction using `START TRANSACTION`, perform multiple SQL operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and then either `COMMIT` the changes to make them permanent or `ROLLBACK` to discard them if an error occurs.

<p>    <table style="border: 1px solid;"><tr style="border: 1px solid; background-color: lightgreen;"><td>sql</td></tr>
<tr><td>    START TRANSACTION;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 123;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE account_id = 456;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    COMMIT;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>    In this example, the transfer of \$100 from account 123 to account 456 is treated as a single transaction. If any of the `UPDATE` statements fail, a `ROLLBACK` would ensure that neither account's balance is incorrectly modified.</p>
</li>
<li> <b>PostgreSQL:</b> Similar to MySQL, PostgreSQL fully supports ACID transactions. You use `BEGIN`, followed by SQL statements, and then `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. PostgreSQL offers more advanced transactional features like savepoints and different isolation levels.

<p>    <table style="border: 1px solid;"><tr style="border: 1px solid; background-color: lightgreen;"><td>sql</td></tr>
<tr><td>    BEGIN;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date) VALUES (101, '2025-05-03');</td></tr>
<tr><td>    SELECT order_id FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 101 ORDER BY order_id DESC LIMIT 1;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (/* retrieved order_id */, 5, 2);</td></tr>
<tr><td>    COMMIT;</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>    Here, creating a new order and adding an item to it are grouped within a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li> <b>SQLite:</b> While often used for embedded databases, SQLite also supports transactions using `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, SQL operations, and `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`. However, its concurrency model for transactions is simpler than more robust server-based DBMS.
</li></ul>
<h3>2. Message Queues:</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>RabbitMQ:</b> Supports transactional messaging through the use of exchanges and queues. While not strictly database transactions, you can ensure that a message is either successfully published to an exchange or not at all. This helps in building reliable asynchronous communication between applications. RabbitMQ's publisher confirms and transactions can be used to achieve different levels of message delivery guarantees.
</li>
<li> <b>Apache Kafka:</b> Kafka introduced transactional capabilities to ensure exactly-once semantics for message processing within certain scopes (single partition, or across multiple partitions within a single topic). This allows applications to consume, process, and produce messages to Kafka topics in an atomic manner. Kafka's transactions are particularly useful in stream processing scenarios.

<p>    <table style="border: 1px solid;"><tr style="border: 1px solid; background-color: lightgreen;"><td>java</td></tr>
<tr><td>    // Example using Kafka Streams with exactly-once processing</td></tr>
<tr><td>    StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();</td></tr>
<tr><td>    KStream<String, String> source = builder.stream("input-topic");</td></tr>
<tr><td>    source.mapValues(value -> process(value))</td></tr>
<tr><td>          .to("output-topic", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), Serdes.String()));</td></tr>
<tr><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>    KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), streamsConfig);</td></tr>
<tr><td>    streams.start();</td></tr>
<tr><td>    </td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>    In Kafka Streams with "exactly-once" processing enabled, the consumption from "input-topic," the processing via `process()`, and the production to "output-topic" can be part of a transactional unit.</p>
</li></ul>
<h3>3. Distributed Transaction Managers:</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Atomikos:</b> This is a Java-based transaction manager that can run on Linux and supports distributed transactions across multiple resource managers (like databases and message queues) using protocols like XA (eXtended Architecture). It allows you to coordinate transactions involving, for example, updates to two different databases, ensuring that both either succeed or both fail.
</li>
<li> <b>JBoss Transactions (formerly Narayana):</b> Another Java-based transaction manager that provides support for various transaction protocols and resource managers in a distributed environment on Linux.
</li></ul>
<h3>4. Version Control Systems:</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Git:</b> While not in the traditional database sense, Git's commit operation can be considered a transaction. A commit bundles a set of changes into a single logical unit. If the commit fails mid-way, the repository remains in a consistent state (either all changes are recorded, or none are). Git's architecture ensures the atomicity and durability of commits.
</li></ul>
<h3>5. Custom Applications:</h3>

<p>Developers building applications on Linux might implement their own transactional logic, especially for critical operations. This could involve:</p>

<ul>
<li> <b>File System Operations:</b> Ensuring that a series of file operations (e.g., moving a file, renaming multiple files) are treated as a single unit, with rollback mechanisms in case of failure. This is often done at the application level.</li>
<li> <b>Inter-process Communication (IPC):</b> When multiple processes need to coordinate and perform a set of actions atomically, custom transaction protocols might be implemented.
</li></ul>
<h3>Key Differences from Mainframe Transactions:</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b>Scope:</b> Mainframe transactions often tightly integrate with the underlying transaction processing monitor (like CICS) and manage resources across a centralized system. In Linux environments, transactions might be more localized to a specific application or service, or they might involve distributed transaction management across multiple systems.</li>
<li> <b>Technology Stack:</b> Mainframe transactions rely on specific mainframe technologies and protocols. Linux transactions utilize a broader range of technologies, including SQL databases, message queues, and distributed transaction managers built on open standards.</li>
<li> <b>Scalability and Distribution:</b> While mainframes excel at vertical scaling of transactions, Linux-based systems often focus on horizontal scalability and distributed transaction management to handle large workloads.

</li></ul>
<p>In summary, while the term "mainframe transaction" has a specific connotation, the fundamental concept of ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) for critical operations is also prevalent in various software applications running on Linux, albeit implemented using different technologies and with varying scopes.</p>
