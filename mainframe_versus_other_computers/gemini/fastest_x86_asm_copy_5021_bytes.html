<h2>I asked Gemini: "fastest x86 assembler code to copy 5021 bytes"</h2>

Okay, let's dive into the fastest x86 assembly code to copy 5021 bytes. The optimal approach depends on the specific x86 architecture you're targeting (older 32-bit, modern 64-bit with AVX-512, etc.) and the surrounding context. However, for a general modern x86-64 processor, leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions is usually the key to achieving the highest throughput for memory copies.

Here's a breakdown of different approaches, starting with the likely fastest:

**Method 1: Using AVX2 or AVX-512 (if available)**

If your target processor supports AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions 2, available on many Intel and AMD processors since around 2013) or AVX-512 (more recent and powerful), these offer the potential for the highest copy speeds by moving large chunks of data in parallel.

**Example using AVX2 (moves 32 bytes at a time):**

```assembly
section .data
    source_data db 0 dup (5021)
    destination_data db 0 dup (5021)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov rsi, source_data      ; Source address
    mov rdi, destination_data ; Destination address
    mov rcx, 5021 / 32        ; Number of 32-byte blocks
    mov rdx, 5021 % 32        ; Remaining bytes

    ; Copy 32-byte blocks using AVX2
copy_avx2_loop:
    vmovdqu ymm0, [rsi]       ; Load 32 bytes from source to ymm0
    vmovdqu [rdi], ymm0       ; Store 32 bytes from ymm0 to destination
    add rsi, 32
    add rdi, 32
    loop copy_avx2_loop

    ; Handle remaining bytes (less than 32)
    cmp rdx, 0
    je .done_copy

    ; Move remaining bytes (up to 31) using smaller moves
    mov ecx, edx
copy_remaining_loop:
    mov bl, [rsi]
    mov [rdi], bl
    inc rsi
    inc rdi
    loop copy_remaining_loop

.done_copy:
    ; Exit program
    mov rax, 60             ; sys_exit
    xor rdi, rdi            ; Exit code 0
    syscall
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **AVX2 Instructions:**
    * `vmovdqu ymm0, [rsi]`: Loads 256 bits (32 bytes) from the memory location pointed to by `rsi` into the `ymm0` register. The `v` prefix indicates a vector instruction, `dqu` means double quadword unaligned.
    * `vmovdqu [rdi], ymm0`: Stores the 32 bytes from `ymm0` to the memory location pointed to by `rdi`.
2.  **Looping:** The code first calculates how many full 32-byte blocks to move and then loops using the `loop` instruction (which decrements `rcx` and jumps if not zero).
3.  **Handling Remainder:** After the main loop, it checks if there are any remaining bytes (less than 32) and moves them byte by byte using `mov bl, [rsi]` and `mov [rdi], bl` in a separate loop.
4.  **Unaligned Moves:** `vmovdqu` is used to handle potentially unaligned memory addresses, which is crucial for general-purpose memory copying.

**Example using AVX-512 (moves 64 bytes at a time - if supported):**

If your processor supports AVX-512, you can move even larger chunks of data at once:

```assembly
section .data
    source_data db 0 dup (5021)
    destination_data db 0 dup (5021)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov rsi, source_data
    mov rdi, destination_data
    mov rcx, 5021 / 64
    mov rdx, 5021 % 64

    ; Copy 64-byte blocks using AVX-512
copy_avx512_loop:
    vmovdqu64 zmm0, [rsi]     ; Load 64 bytes from source to zmm0
    vmovdqu64 [rdi], zmm0     ; Store 64 bytes from zmm0 to destination
    add rsi, 64
    add rdi, 64
    loop copy_avx512_loop

    ; Handle remaining bytes (less than 64) - similar to AVX2
    cmp rdx, 0
    je .done_copy

    mov ecx, edx
copy_remaining_loop:
    mov bl, [rsi]
    mov [rdi], bl
    inc rsi
    inc rdi
    loop copy_remaining_loop

.done_copy:
    ; Exit program
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
```

**Method 2: Using `rep movsb` (Repeat String Byte)**

As discussed previously, `rep movsb` is a dedicated instruction for memory copying and is often highly optimized on modern x86 processors, especially for larger transfers. It's simpler to implement than SIMD but might not reach the absolute peak throughput of wide vector instructions.

```assembly
section .data
    source_data db 0 dup (5021)
    destination_data db 0 dup (5021)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov rsi, source_data
    mov rdi, destination_data
    mov rcx, 5021
    cld                     ; Clear direction flag (forward copy)
    rep movsb               ; Repeat move byte ECX times

    ; Exit program
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
```

**Method 3: Using Larger Scalar Moves (e.g., `movq`)**

You can also move data in larger chunks using scalar instructions like `movq` (move quadword, 8 bytes) in 64-bit mode. This can be faster than byte-by-byte moves but generally slower than SIMD or optimized `rep movsb`.

```assembly
section .data
    source_data db 0 dup (5021)
    destination_data db 0 dup (5021)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov rsi, source_data
    mov rdi, destination_data
    mov rcx, 5021 / 8
    mov rdx, 5021 % 8

    ; Copy 8-byte blocks
copy_qword_loop:
    mov qword ptr [rdi], [rsi]
    add rsi, 8
    add rdi, 8
    loop copy_qword_loop

    ; Handle remaining bytes
    cmp rdx, 0
    je .done_copy

    mov ecx, edx
copy_remaining_loop:
    mov bl, [rsi]
    mov [rdi], bl
    inc rsi
    inc rdi
    loop copy_remaining_loop

.done_copy:
    ; Exit program
    mov rax, 60
    xor rdi, rdi
    syscall
```

**Which method is fastest?**

* **For modern x86-64 processors with AVX2 or AVX-512 support, the SIMD-based approach (Method 1) will likely offer the highest throughput.** Moving 32 or 64 bytes at a time in parallel significantly reduces the number of instructions and loop iterations.
* **`rep movsb` (Method 2) is a strong contender and often very efficient.** Modern processors have dedicated optimizations for it. For this specific size (5021 bytes), it might be very close in performance to the SIMD approach, especially if the SIMD code isn't perfectly optimized or if there are frequent context switches.
* **Using larger scalar moves (Method 3) is generally faster than byte-by-byte but slower than SIMD or a well-optimized `rep movsb` for this size.**

**Key Considerations for Speed:**

* **Alignment:** While the `vmovdqu` instruction handles unaligned data, aligned memory access is generally faster. If you know your source and destination are aligned to 32 or 64-byte boundaries, you could use aligned move instructions (`vmovdqa`, `vmovaps`, etc.) for potentially slightly better performance. However, for a general-purpose copy, unaligned moves are safer.
* **Overhead:** For very small transfers, the setup overhead of SIMD instructions might outweigh their benefits. However, 5021 bytes is large enough that SIMD should be advantageous if available.
* **Processor Architecture:** Performance can vary between Intel and AMD processors and across different microarchitectures. Benchmarking on your target system is the ultimate way to determine the absolute fastest method.
* **Context:** In a real-world scenario, the surrounding code and cache state can also influence performance.

**Recommendation:**

For copying 5021 bytes on a modern x86-64 system, **starting with an AVX2 implementation (Method 1) is a good bet for potentially the highest speed.** If AVX-512 is available, that would be even faster. However, **`rep movsb` (Method 2) provides a simpler and often very competitive solution that is well-optimized in hardware.**

You would need to assemble and benchmark these different versions on your target hardware to definitively determine the absolute fastest. Using a tool like `nasm` to assemble and then timing the execution would be necessary for precise measurements.
