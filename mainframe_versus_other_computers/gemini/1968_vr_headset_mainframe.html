Yes, the **1968 VR headset, The Sword of Damocles, was indeed controlled by a computer, though not what we would typically think of as a modern mainframe.**

The computer used to generate the graphics and respond to the head tracking of the Sword of Damocles was a **DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation) PDP-1**.

Here's why this is important in the context of your question:

* **PDP-1:** The PDP-1 was a significant early minicomputer. While powerful for its time, it was considerably smaller and less powerful than the large mainframe systems that were prevalent in many enterprise and research environments of the 1960s.
* **Real-time Graphics:** Generating and updating the 3D wireframe graphics in response to the user's head movements required a dedicated processing unit. The PDP-1 was capable of this real-time computation, which was a remarkable feat for the technology of the era.
* **Pioneering Interaction:** The connection between the head tracking of the headset and the computer-generated imagery displayed to the user was a crucial step in creating an interactive virtual experience.

So, while it wasn't a room-sized mainframe in the way we might picture one, the Sword of Damocles was definitely controlled by a sophisticated (for the time) computer system – the DEC PDP-1 – which was essential for its groundbreaking functionality.

<h2>how big was the pdp-1</h2>

The DEC PDP-1 was a significant piece of hardware for its time, and while not a modern mainframe, it was substantial in size. It typically consisted of **multiple cabinets** that together measured approximately:

* **Height:** 6 feet (around 1.8 meters)
* **Width:** 8 feet (around 2.4 meters)
* **Depth:** 2 feet (around 0.6 meters)

So, it occupied a significant footprint, taking up a noticeable portion of a room. It wasn't a small desktop machine by any means.

It also weighed around **1,200 pounds (approximately 544 kilograms)**.

Therefore, the PDP-1, while a minicomputer, was quite large and heavy compared to modern computers, reflecting the technology of the 1960s which relied on discrete components and magnetic core memory.
