<h1>I asked Gemini: "fastest x86 assembler code to strcpy"</h1>

You're aiming for the absolute fastest x86 assembler `strcpy` implementation. This is a classic challenge with several approaches, and the optimal one often depends on the target microarchitecture and optimization level. Here's a breakdown of the fastest techniques, focusing on modern x86-64:

**Key Optimization Strategies:**

1.  **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):** Processing multiple bytes in parallel using instructions from SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions), AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), and AVX-512 (if available) can significantly boost throughput.
2.  **Unaligned Loads and Stores:** Efficiently handling potentially unaligned source and destination addresses is crucial for a general-purpose `strcpy`.
3.  **Early Null Termination Check:** Quickly identifying the end of the source string is essential to avoid unnecessary memory accesses.
4.  **Loop Unrolling:** Reducing loop overhead by processing multiple elements within a single loop iteration.

**Fastest Approaches (Modern x86-64):**

**Method 1: Optimized AVX2 Implementation (Likely the Fastest on Many Modern CPUs)**

This approach loads and stores 32 bytes (256 bits) at a time using AVX2 instructions. It needs careful handling of the initial and final parts of the string, especially if they are not multiples of 32 bytes or are unaligned.

```assembly
section .text
    global strcpy

strcpy:
    push rbp
    mov rbp, rsp

    mov rdi, rsi        ; Destination pointer (d)
    mov rsi, rdx        ; Source pointer (s)
    xor rax, rax        ; Zero out rax (for null byte checks)

    ; Align destination pointer to 32-byte boundary if needed (optional, but can improve AVX performance)
    ; ... (alignment code omitted for brevity - involves masking and checking) ...

.avx2_loop:
    vmovdqu ymm0, [rsi]     ; Load 32 bytes from source
    vmovdqu [rdi], ymm0     ; Store 32 bytes to destination
    add rsi, 32
    add rdi, 32
    vpmovmskb eax, ymm0     ; Create a bitmask of the most significant bit of each byte
    test eax, eax          ; Check if any byte in the 32-byte block is zero
    jnz .avx2_check_null

    cmp rsi, rdx          ; Basic safety check to prevent overreading (can be optimized)
    jb .avx2_loop

    jmp .copy_remaining

.avx2_check_null:
    bsf ecx, eax          ; Find the index of the first zero byte
    mov byte [rdi + rcx], 0 ; Write the null terminator
    jmp .done

.copy_remaining:
    ; Handle remaining bytes (less than 32 or unaligned start)
    movzx eax, byte [rsi]
    mov [rdi], al
    inc rsi
    inc rdi
    test al, al
    jnz .copy_remaining

.done:
    mov rax, rdi        ; Return pointer to the end of the destination string
    sub rax, rbp        ; Calculate length (optional, for demonstration)
    pop rbp
    ret
```

**Explanation of AVX2 Approach:**

* **Initialization:** Sets up pointers and clears `rax`.
* **Alignment (Optional but Recommended):** Aligning the destination pointer to a 32-byte boundary can improve the performance of AVX loads and stores.
* **AVX2 Loop:** Loads 32 bytes at a time using `vmovdqu` (unaligned move). Stores 32 bytes.
* **Null Byte Check:** `vpmovmskb` creates a bitmask where each bit corresponds to the most significant bit of a byte in the `ymm0` register. If a byte is zero (null terminator), its MSB will be 0. `test eax, eax` checks if the mask is non-zero (meaning no null byte found in the block).
* **Finding Null:** `bsf` (bit scan forward) finds the index of the first set bit (which corresponds to the first non-null byte from the end of the block). Subtracting this from 32 gives the offset of the null byte.
* **Copying Remaining:** Handles the initial part before alignment and the final part after the last full 32-byte block, copying byte by byte until the null terminator is found.
* **Return Value:** Returns a pointer to the end of the destination string (for `strcpy` convention).

**Method 2: Optimized `rep movsb` with Prefetching (Potentially Very Competitive)**

Modern x86 processors have significantly optimized the `rep movsb` instruction for memory copying. Combining it with prefetching can further improve performance by bringing data into the cache before it's needed.

```assembly
section .text
    global strcpy

strcpy:
    push rbp
    mov rbp, rsp

    mov rdi, rsi        ; Destination pointer (d)
    mov rsi, rdx        ; Source pointer (s)
    xor ecx, ecx        ; Initialize counter

.find_null:
    cmp byte [rsi + rcx], 0 ; Check for null terminator
    je .copy_loop
    inc ecx
    prefetchnta [rsi + rcx + 64] ; Non-temporal prefetch ahead
    jmp .find_null

.copy_loop:
    inc ecx             ; Include the null terminator
    cld                 ; Clear direction flag (forward)
    rep movsb           ; Copy bytes from [rsi] to [rdi]

    mov rax, rdi        ; Return pointer to the end of the destination string
    add rax, rcx        ; Adjust for the copied length
    pop rbp
    ret
```

**Explanation of `rep movsb` with Prefetching:**

* **Find Null:** Scans the source string to find the null terminator and stores the length in `ecx`. Prefetching (`prefetchnta` - non-temporal hint) attempts to bring data into the cache without polluting it for future non-temporal accesses.
* **Copy Loop:** Increments `ecx` to include the null terminator. Sets the direction flag for forward copying (`cld`). Uses the `rep movsb` instruction to copy `ecx` bytes from `[rsi]` to `[rdi]`.
* **Return Value:** Calculates and returns the pointer to the end of the destination string.

**Method 3: Hybrid Approach (SIMD for Bulk, Scalar for Ends)**

A hybrid approach combines the high throughput of SIMD for the main part of the string with scalar (byte-by-byte or small word) moves for the potentially unaligned beginning and the final few bytes after the last full SIMD block. This tries to balance the benefits of wide vector operations with the need to handle arbitrary alignments and the terminating null byte efficiently.

**Which Method is Fastest?**

* **On modern x86-64 CPUs with good AVX2/AVX-512 support, the optimized SIMD implementations (Method 1 or a well-tuned hybrid) often achieve the highest raw throughput for large strings.** However, the complexity of handling alignment and the null terminator efficiently can make the implementation challenging.
* **The optimized `rep movsb` with prefetching (Method 2) is often surprisingly competitive and can be simpler to implement correctly.** Modern processors have dedicated hardware optimizations for this instruction, and prefetching can mitigate memory latency. For many real-world scenarios, this might be the sweet spot between speed and complexity.
* **Older SIMD (SSE) can still provide significant speedups over purely scalar code but is generally slower than AVX2/AVX-512.**

**Important Considerations for Maximum Speed:**

* **Alignment:** While unaligned SIMD moves are available, aligned access is generally faster. If you can guarantee alignment (or handle the aligned main part separately), you might see further gains.
* **Cache Locality:** Prefetching helps with cache locality.
* **Microarchitecture:** Performance can vary significantly between different Intel and AMD microarchitectures. What's fastest on one CPU might not be the absolute fastest on another.
* **String Length:** For very short strings, the overhead of SIMD setup might not be worth it, and a simple byte-by-byte copy might be faster. However, for strings of significant length, SIMD shines.
* **Compiler Intrinsics:** High-performing `strcpy` implementations in standard C libraries often use similar SIMD and `rep movsb` techniques, sometimes with very specific microarchitecture optimizations. Examining the assembly output of highly optimized library functions can provide further insights.

**Recommendation:**

For a balance of potential speed and relative simplicity on modern x86-64, **the optimized `rep movsb` with prefetching (Method 2) is a strong contender.** If you are targeting a specific microarchitecture and are willing to invest more effort in handling alignment and edge cases, a well-implemented AVX2 (or AVX-512) version (Method 1 or a hybrid) could potentially be faster for longer strings.

**Benchmarking is Crucial:** The only way to definitively determine the absolute fastest `strcpy` implementation for your specific target environment is to implement and benchmark different approaches with realistic string lengths and alignment scenarios.
