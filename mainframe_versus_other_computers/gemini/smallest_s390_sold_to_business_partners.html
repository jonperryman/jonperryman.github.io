<h3>I asked Gemini: ""</h3>

<h2>I asked Gemini: "smallest ibm s390 sold to business partners"</h2>

<p>While the term "smallest" can be subjective and depend on what criteria you're using (physical size, processing power, or entry-level cost), one of the smallest IBM S/390 systems specifically marketed and sold to business partners was the <b>IBM System/390 Integrated Server 3006.</b></p>

<p>Here's why it fits the description of a small S/390 sold to businesses:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Integrated Design:</b> It was designed as a more self-contained unit, aiming to bring S/390 capabilities to smaller businesses or specific departments within larger organizations.</li>

<li><b>Smaller Footprint:</b> Compared to traditional multi-frame S/390 mainframes, the 3006 had a significantly smaller physical size, although likely still larger than a typical desktop PC of today.</li>

<li><b>Business Focus:</b> It was explicitly sold to business partners and targeted at providing mainframe-level reliability and security for smaller-scale deployments or specialized applications.</li>

<li><b>Operating System Flexibility:</b> It could run various S/390 operating systems like OS/390, VM/ESA, and VSE/ESA, as well as Linux, offering flexibility for different business needs.</li>
</ul>


<p>While specific dimensions might vary depending on the exact model and configuration, the IBM System/390 Integrated Server 3006 represented a move towards making S/390 technology more accessible in a smaller, integrated package for business users.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the S/390 line evolved into the zSeries (now zSystems), and modern entry-level options like the single-frame IBM z16 or LinuxONE III offer even more computing power in relatively compact footprints for today's business needs. However, looking specifically at the S/390 era, the Integrated Server 3006 stands out as one of the smallest IBM mainframe offerings sold to business partners.</p>
