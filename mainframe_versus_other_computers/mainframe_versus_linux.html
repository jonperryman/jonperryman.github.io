<h2>Linux is all hype and no substance!<br />
	Debunking decades of lies from Linux softwaare engineers</h2>

	<p>By the time you read this to the end, you will conclude that much of what you believe about Linux &amp; C is not reality. Just because they serve a purpose, does not mean they do it well.</p>
	
	<p><b>Motivated reasoning</b>: a person will ignore all common sense and real facts because they need to believe in something that is completely wrong.</p>

	<p>It's time to be brutally honest! Linux and C has caused the decay of simple and basic design skills. Look no farther than the decades of debunked lies that persist to this day.</p>

	<p>It's time computer educators (software and hardware) <b>teach the basics that have been lost.</b> It's time they open their students eyes to the lies that have convinced them they are exceptional compared to the <b>dinosaur IBM mainframe.</b></p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="/mainframe_versus_other_computers/img/lemmings.gif" /></div>

<h2 id="toc_0">Linux and C are Broken As Designed (BAD)!</h3>

	<p>This is the one thing software engineers can never admit. This list is about the lies you must tell yourself because you need Linux to be the greatest OS ever and C the greatest programming language. This is about the lies you need to justify your hatred for the mainframe when the reality is its decades ahead of every other computer architecture and operating system.</p>

	<p>After reviewing this list of debunked Linux Lies, <b>name 1 design that Linux and C software engineers designed correctly!</b> While their designs solve a problem, they introduce new problems. The real question is how anyone considers these great designs.</p>

	<p>Despising the mainframe, while popular, is not a valid reason to ignore Linux and C failures. There are a lot of failuress that are being ignored.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Dumbing down to the computer basics because of Linux &amp; C<br />
	Even Google engineers don't truly understand the basics of computing</h3>
	
	<p>Understanding of the most basic and most important computer skills has been lost because of the decline of the IBM mainframe. Since software engineers (falsely) believe they understand servers, let's start with "servers".</p>

<hr /><h2 id="toc_2">Software engineers no longer understand "servers"</h3>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL</b>, Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>I asked ChatGpt for the <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/modern_definition_server.html');">"modern definition of a server"</span>. <b>ROTFLOL</b>, Linux cannot concieve of a server that is not <b>"internet"</b> based. Additionally virtualization (virtual machines) plays an extremely important role in the Linux server concept. These are 2 of several concepts that cause Linux to perform so badly.</p>
	
<h2 id="toc_3">How can 2 servers working together<br />
	not be distributed yet 64 miles apart?</h3>

	<p>I wanted to read something insanely stupid, so I asked ChatGpt: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/modern_definition_server.html');">is the mainframe a distributed computer?"</span> which as expected replied emphatically <b>"NO"</b>. <b>ROTFLOL</b>, ChatGPT knew this was a lie because when I asked ChatGPT: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/max_distance_between_mainframes.html');">"what is the maximum distance between mainframes?"</span>.</p>

	<p>How can 2 mainframes be upto 64 miles apart and not be distributed at the same time? It also says that using Linux server concepts (called loosely coupled), have no distance restrictions. Think again if you believe that non-mainframe servers cannot be tightly coupled. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)" target="mainframe_topic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a> is actually a tightly coupled blade server farm (43,808 servers) running CrayOS.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">IBM designing great server technology since 1965<br />
	while Linux fails time and again since 1990</h3>

	<p>I asked ChatGpt: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/2841_disk_controller.html');">"tell us about IBM 2841"</span></p>
	<p>I asked ChatGpt: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/2703_controller_timeline.html');">"timeline of the ibm 2703"</span></p>
		
		need to understand that their knowledge &amp; expertise is limited to Linux. say they understand but clearly they don't. This page is about educating Linux &amp; Unix software engineers whose limited understanding of software designs has them falsely believing lies. For far too long, IBM has described the mainframe capabilities that software engineers don't comprehend.<p></p>
	
<hr /><h2 id="toc_5">Lie 1: Mainframes &amp; Supercomputers are specialized computers<br />
	while Linux computers are great at generalized computing</h3>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>There is very little difference between any of these computers. It has been proven that any operating system is capable of running on most computers. Other than an IBM License, any of the IBM mainframe operating systems will run happily but with degraded performance on any of these computers.</p>  

<h2 id="toc_6">The largest supercomputer is actually a server farm</h3>

	<p>The El Capitan Supercomputer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)" target="mainframe_topic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a> is actually a server farm consisting of 43,808 blade servers each containing 2 AMD x86 CPU's and 1 AMD GPU. Google could replace their 5,000,000 servers (&amp; GPUs) with 114 El Capitan supercomputers.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">A quarter century<br />
	Linux running on IBM mainframe computers<br />
	IBM mainframe operating systems running on non-mainframe computers</h3>

	<p>How many more decades before people learn that "mainframe" has never had a definable meaning? IBM operating systems happily run on other computers without any special hardware. Linux happily runs on IBM mainframe hardware. Just because this occurred in 2000, does not mean it couldn't have occurred with the first PC. It simply means there was no demand!</p>

	<p>The mainframe (both hardware &amp; software) is not specialized as Linux software engineers claim and has always been fully capable of doing everything peformed by Linux. These capabilities did not exist because there wasn't sufficient demand. Linux costing $0 running on cheap computers is great motivation to ignore the mainframe.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">Lie #1 summary: no real difference in capabilities</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mainframe and supercomputer are meaningless words.</li>
	<li>El Capitan supercomputer proves Linux has the capacity to equal the IBM mainframe but sadly lacks the skills to follow through.</li>
	<li>Desktops and laptops are dominated by Microsoft and Apple. Despite Linux and ChromeOS (Google Linux) being free, after decades they failed achieve their goal of becoming the dominant desktop.</li>
	<li>IBM mainframe ignored desktops and laptops. They didn't waant to fail like Linux and ChromeOS.</li>
