<h1>Debunking decades of lies by the Linux community<br />
	The rapid decay of software design skills</h1>
	
	<p><b>Motivated reasoning</b>: a person's need to be a software expert is so strong that they ignore common sense and real facts!</p>

	<p>It's time to be brutally honest and examine a few of the decades of lies coming from the Linux community. And the detrimental impact these lies have on simple and basic software design skills. It's time for computer engineering educators to reconsider their philosophy because they justify modernization that is based on lies.</p>

<h1>Linux is Broken As Designed (BAD)!<br />
	Is "closed source" Redhat Linux a sign of future?</h1>

	<p>After reviewing this list of debunked Linux Lies, <b>name 1 design that Linux and C software engineers designed correctly!</b> While their designs solve their problem, the real question is how they consider these great designs.</p>

	<p>IBM RedHat is now closed source and we can only speculate as to why. It's doubtful that this is about increasing RedHat revenue since people will simply move to another Linux distribution. Far more likely is that IBM wants to modernize and reimagine a Linux built for the future. Linux can be repaired but at great cost and effort. Being closed sourced allows IBM to benefit from the efforts required to modernize.</p>

	<p>It's time to wake up and stop putting lipstick on this pig!</p>

<h1>Most advanced computer in the world is despised<br />
	delusional minds believing Linux lies about IBM mainframes</h1>

	<p>Despite Google's deep pockets and an understanding of Linux, Google has 0 IBM mainframes in their 5,000,000 servers and lacks the design skills to make Linux a real success.</p>

	<p>Software engineers despise the IBM mainframe because it greatly limits their control. I'm not advocating for companies to use mainframe OS's. Instead, the industry needs to look at IBM's strength of design, learn from it and redesign Linux and C.</p>

	<p>Despising the mainframe, while popular, is not a valid reason to ignore Linux failures and there are a lot that are being ignored. </p>

<h1>Dumbing down to the computer basics<br />
	because even Google engineers don't understand great designs</h1>
	
	<p>Software engineers say they understand but clearly they don't. This page is about educating Linux &amp; Unix software engineers whose limited understanding of software designs has them falsely believing lies. For far too long, IBM has described the mainframe capabilities that software engineers don't comprehend.</p>
	
<hr /><h2 id="toc_0">Lie 1: Mainframes &amp; Supercomputers are specialized computers<br />
	while Linux computers are great at generalized computing</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>The El Capitan Supercomputer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)" target="mainframe_topic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a> is actually a server farm consisting of 43,808 blade servers each containing 2 AMD x86 CPU's and 1 AMD GPU. Google could replace their 5,000,000 servers (&amp; GPUs) with 114 El Capitan supercomputers.</p>

	<h2 id="toc_1">Since 2000, non-mainframe computers running IBM mainframe OS's<br />
		Since 2000, Linux running on IBM mainframes</h2>

	<p>The mainframe (both hardware &amp; software) is not specialized and has always been fully capable of doing everything peformed by Linux. The features did not exist because there wasn't sufficient demand. Linux costing $0 is great motivation.</p>

	<p>How many more decades before people learn that "mainframe" has never had a definable meaning? IBM operating systems happily run on other computers without any special hardware. Linux happily runs on IBM mainframe hardware. Just because this occurred in 2000, does not mean it couldn't have occurred with the first PC. It simply means there was no demand!</p>
