<h1>Under construction and incomplete</h1>

<p>New lies to be added here after they are discussed on IBM-MAIN.</p>

<h1>Linux software developers still believe all the lies
	<br/>Understanding Google's lack of basic computer skills</h1>

	<p>Like Google, you believe all the lies about the mainframe. In particular that it's an obsolete dinosaur. You incorrectly believe Google is a great computer company because of their computer expertise but sadly you ignore that they don't understand simple basic computer concepts. Not 1 IBM mainframe at Google despite 5,000,000 servers, 182,000 employees and tons of software (e.g. Android, ChromeOS, Go, Chrome browser, Waymo and much more.</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bernstein-survey-shows-cios-focused-on-software-and-cloud-with-weak-sentiment-on-mainframes-93CH-3761586" class="center-container"><img height="300" src="mainframe_decline.png"/></a></p>
	<hr style="display: none;"/>
	
	<h2>It's time to be brutally honest with yourself<br/>Answering why the mainframe still exist</h2>

	<p>My focus here are the <b>facts</b> about Linux features that Linux software developers incorrectly believe that makes Linux an outstanding success. Let's forget about listing mainframe features because you need to understand why companies remain with the greatest computer to this day.</p>

	<p>Linux has been available on the mainframe for the last 25 years, so <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(telum_grok);">I asked the GROK AI, "Is the IBM Telum the fastest CPU?".</span> The Answer was horrifying. A quarter century of Linux on the mainframe and computer professionals still believe the same lies they used to justify their expertise in the past.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="lemmings.gif" /></div>

	<p><span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(telum_grok);">GROK boasted about wonderful mainframe features (E.g. 100,000 transactions per second)</span> but failed to mention that Linux on the mainframe doesn't provide these same features despite being on the same hardware.</p>
	
	<p>On the mainframe, Linux and C are Broken As Designed (BAD). IBM RedHat Linux is now closed source which begs the question, will they fix Linux for the mainframe. It's time to stop putting lipstick on this pig and see the blemishes. It's time for computer professors to teach real computer fundamentals.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

	<br/><hr/><h2>Lie #1: Google understands "Distributed computing"</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL</b> (Rolling On The Floor, Laughing Out Loud)! Google has 5,000,000 servers but not 1 mainframe. IBM estimates that Linux running on a 256 core mainframe is the equivalent of 2,000 x86 cores (roughly 100 x86 servers) which would potentially reduce Google to 50,000 servers. With Google's extensive knowledge of Linux, they should be able to reduce this to a few thousand servers.</p>

	<p>Linux misconceptions has created an endless list of crappy "distributed computing" solutions (e.g. kubernetes, "The Cloud", microservices, pub/sub, grid, NFS, consumer & suppliers and too many more to list here). Surely another will be coming next week. How many more attempts will it take for Linux to solve the "Distributed computing" problem?</p>

	<p>35 years ago, the IBM mainframe created "Sysplex" to solve the "distributed computing" problem. A single well designed solution which Linux could have implemented but instead, chooses crappy solutions that never fully solve the problem.</p>

	<p>While you say Linux solutions exist on the mainframe, remember they exist solely for Linux "distributed computing" which lack Sysplex features.</p>

	<h2>IRS mainframe modernization 
		<br/>implementing Linux "Distributed computing" concepts</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b>The IRS is currently "modernizing" their mainframe using JAVA and the Linux "distributed computing" database solution (JDBC) instead of Sysplex. JAVA was designed using Linux / Unix concepts which is why IBM discounts computers for customers using JAVA. They expect to sell more mainframes to those customers to offset the discount. They also realize these applications will remain on the mainframe (or mainframe for Linux) because moving to x86 will most likelyy require a re-write.</p>

<template id="telum_grok">
	<h1>I asked X Grok (AI) "Is IBM Telum the fastest CPU?"<br/>
		I was horrified by the lies people still believe</h1>
	<hr/>
	<H2>Determining whether the IBM Telum CPU is "faster than all others" depends on the context—specifically, what "faster" means (e.g., clock speed, throughput, latency, or specialized workloads) and which CPUs it’s being compared to. The Telum, introduced in 2021 for IBM’s z16 mainframe systems, is a highly specialized processor designed for enterprise workloads like financial transactions, real-time AI inference (e.g., fraud detection), and extreme reliability. It’s not a general-purpose CPU like those in consumer PCs or even most data center servers, so a direct comparison to "all others" requires nuance.</H2>
	<P>The original Telum operates at a base clock speed exceeding 5 GHz (often cited as 5.2 GHz), with eight cores per chip, and scales up to 256 cores across 32 chips in a full mainframe system. Each core has a massive 32 MB private L2 cache, which can act as a virtual L3 (256 MB) or L4 (2 GB) cache across the system, optimizing low-latency access for high-volume transactional workloads. It also includes a 6 TFLOPS on-chip AI accelerator, boosting performance for specific AI tasks. The newer Telum II, announced in 2024, pushes this further with a 5.5 GHz clock, 36 MB L2 cache per core (360 MB virtual L3, 2.88 GB virtual L4), and a 24 TOPS AI accelerator, claiming up to 70% performance improvement over its predecessor in key system components.</P>
	<H2>Clock Speed Comparison</H2>
	<p>Telum (5.2 GHz) and Telum II (5.5 GHz) have among the highest base clock speeds for server-grade CPUs. Most modern server CPUs, like AMD EPYC (e.g., Zen 4, base ~3.0–4.0 GHz, boost up to 5.7 GHz) or Intel Xeon (e.g., Sapphire Rapids, base ~2.0–3.7 GHz, boost up to 4.1 GHz), prioritize core count over clock speed and rely on turbo boosts that don’t sustain as consistently as Telum’s fixed frequency.</p>
	
	<p>Consumer CPUs, like AMD Ryzen 9 7950X (up to 5.7 GHz boost) or Intel Core i9-14900K (up to 6.0 GHz boost), can exceed Telum’s clock speed but are designed for different workloads (e.g., gaming, single-threaded tasks) and lack the enterprise-grade reliability and scalability of mainframes.</p>
	
	<h2>Throughput and Workload-Specific Performance</h2>
	<p>Telum shines in throughput for transactional workloads. A fully loaded z16 with 256 Telum cores can process tens of thousands of transactions per second with sub-millisecond latency—critical for banking or insurance systems. This is less about raw compute (e.g., FLOPS) and more about consistent, predictable performance. For contrast:</p>
	<p>AMD EPYC 9754 (128 cores, 256 threads, ~3.0 GHz) or Intel Xeon Platinum 8592+ (64 cores, 128 threads, ~3.9 GHz boost) offer higher core counts and raw multi-threaded compute, excelling in HPC or cloud workloads but not necessarily in low-latency, high-reliability transaction processing.</p>
	
	<p>NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., H100, 3000+ INT8 TOPS) or dedicated AI accelerators dwarf Telum’s 24 TOPS for AI training or inference, but they’re not CPUs and don’t handle general-purpose tasks.</p>
	
	<h2>Specialized Features</h2>
	<p>Telum’s on-chip AI accelerator and cache design (virtual L3/L4) give it an edge in real-time AI inference embedded in transactions—something neither x86 CPUs nor consumer chips replicate at the same scale or latency. Its reliability (seven nines uptime, or milliseconds of downtime per year) also outclasses typical server CPUs, which prioritize flexibility over such extreme consistency.</p>
	<h2>Limitations</h2>
	<p>Telum isn’t "faster" in every metric:</p>
	<p>Core Count: With only 8 cores per chip (256 max in a system), it’s dwarfed by EPYC’s 128 or Xeon’s 64+ cores per socket for parallel workloads.</p>
	<p>General Compute: It’s not built for high-performance computing (e.g., scientific simulations) or consumer tasks (e.g., gaming), where x86 or ARM CPUs dominate.</p>
	
	<p>AI Raw Power: Dedicated accelerators like NVIDIA’s H100 or Google’s TPUs far exceed Telum’s AI performance for training or large-scale inference.</p>
	
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	</p>The IBM Telum (and Telum II) isn’t universally "faster than all others." It’s exceptionally fast—perhaps unmatched—in its niche: high-volume, low-latency, AI-infused transactional workloads with extreme reliability. For general-purpose computing, raw multi-threaded performance, or specialized AI tasks, other CPUs or accelerators (e.g., EPYC, Xeon, GPUs) outperform it. Its speed is tailored to mainframe demands, not a one-size-fits-all metric. If you’re asking about a specific use case or comparison (e.g., Telum vs. EPYC for a workload), let me know, and I can dig deeper!</p>

	<p>Just because Linux does a job doesn't mean it does it well. Nothing rings more true about Linux and it's advocates than this. For decades, Linux touted it is the future of desktops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">Microsoft Windows and Apple proved them wrong with 90% of today's market share</a> <b>despite Linux desktop being free! It clearly doesn't do desktops well.</b> </p>

	<p>If, for z/OS, you ignore $$$$ and that Linux application programmers demand to be the masters of their domain, the simple basic facts show IBM z/OS is by far the best server. For example, Linux still does not have the basic concept of serialized shared files. The functionality is part of application programmers domain which is why Linux is popular.</p>

	<p>There is nothing preventing Linux from implementing every z/OS innovation. Pray that IBM going closed source with Redhat signals they are <b>integrating z/OS innovations into Linux for IBM Z</b>.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

	<p>You can put lipstick on this pig but at the end of the day, Linux is still a pig. Microsoft and Apple proved this pig isn't suitable as a desktop even when it's free! </p>
	
	<p>It's time to put this beauty queen into competition with z/OS. Let's consider a few obvious impacts caused by the poor design of Linux:</p>
	<ul>

<h2>Half the z/OS customers intend to move to Linux<br/>
	The computer industry is easily deceived </h2>

<h2>The legendary <a href="https://watsonwalker.com/about-us/">Cheryl Watson</a><br/>
	Performance wisdom the computer industry failed to learn</h2>

	<p class="center-container"><img height="200" src="https://watsonwalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cheryl.jpg" alt="Cheryl Watson photo" /></p>

	<p>Cheryl's job <b>wasn't</b> to tell you to buy a faster Ferrari. Her job was to make your existing Ferrari run faster and she knew how to make it scream.</p>

	<p>Using Cheryl's z/OS insights, Linux software design failures become painfully obvious. z/OS performance basics are relevant to Linux although they are extremely difficult to apply to Linux because of it's current implementation. z/OS and Linux for IBM Z both run on IBM System Z hardware and All failures lie within improper software design.</p>

<h2>Linux developers are the master of their domain<br/>
	Sysprogs are vital to every z/OS shop</h2>

	<p>All z/OS shops have sysprogs (performance, security, dasd, IMS, CICS and more). These positions rarely exist in Linux shops. More often, every Linux developer is tasked with all these duties.</p>

	<p>While </p>

<h2>Google has 5,000,000 Linux servers<br/>
	None are Linux for IBM Z</h2>

	<p>For decades, we've been deceived into believing Linux is an efficient OS. Linux for IBM Z proves <b>Linux is poorly designed and inefficient</b>. It runs faster but is not worth the extra $$$$.</p>

	<p>We know IBM Z is many times faster than any other server on the market because a single LPAR can run <a href="https://share.confex.com/share/122/webprogram/Handout/Session14772/IMS14772.pdf">more than 100,000 IMS transactions per second</a>.</p>

	<p>This also demonstrates that the software innovations designed into z/OS are many times more efficient than Linux.</p>

	<p>If we ignoreMotivated reasoning has the computer industry ignoring simple facts showing Linux screwed up badly from the start with it's poor design philosophy.</p>


	<p>After so many decades, Linux and Unix continue to deceive the computer industry about IBM mainframes! Anyone thinking that</p>
	
	<p>They could not deceive the public by their demands of replacing Microsoft Windows and Apple. That's embarrassing. 90% of the public knows you get what you pay for and they refuse to embrace Linux desktop despite it being free.</p>


	<h2>Linux doesn't stand up to well designed software</h2>

	<p>It comes down to $$$$. The cheapest IBM LinuxOne is half the price of an IBM Z, despite being essentially the same computer. Linux for IBM Z could easily be designed to perform as well as z/OS but does not perform anywhere as well as z/OS, thus the need to make LinuxOne so cheap.</p>

	<p>The failure of Linux in the desktop market should not instill confidence. Linux is a jack of all trades but master of none. Comparisons are based on Linux's ability to do everything instead of how well it does each task. It does desktop but it does not do it well.</p>

	<p>After 25 years of Linux for IBM Z, we still ignore fair and honest comparisons with simple yet obvious design flaws. z/OS obviously can't run on x86, RISCV nor any other non-IBM Z computers</p>



	<h2>The public won't be duped by false Linux advertising<br/> 
		Linux failed for decades saying the most advanced OS (Linux) will replace all desktops
		</h2>
	
		<p>How is it that computer people are so gullible to believe in the grandeur of Linux when the public can't be duped? Decades of being told the desktop from the greatest OS (Linux & Unix) will replace all desktops. Decades later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">90% are willing to pay for Microsoft Windows and Apple (Mac, Macbook, iMac and ...)</a> instead of moving to the free Linux desktop.</p>

<h2>Linux & Microsoft, innovation driven by others</h2>

	<p>We falsely attribute leaps in innovation to Linux & Microsoft. The reality is they simply made innovations available to the masses.</p>

	<p>x86 CPU's exist because of Microsoft. Despite RISC & RISCV CPU's existing solely for Linux & Unix yet Linux desktops and servers use x86.</p>

	<p>x86 innovations come primarly from Microsoft because of C#. Linux is written in C using a limited set of CPU instructions. With x86 instruction documentation being 6,000 pages, very little of that documentation is useful to C programmers. It takes Microsoft C# to take full advan</p>

<h2>Linux: A world of poorly designed software and hardware!<br/>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

	<p>You can put lipstick on this pig but at the end of the day, it's still a pig. Microsoft and Apple proved this pig isn't suitable as a desktop even when it's free!</p>
	
	<p>Let's put this beauty queen in competition with z/OS. Let's even put IBM z/OS at a great disadvantage by comparing DB2 for z/OS to any transactional database available for Linux running on any type of hardware including DB2 for zLinux.</p>

	<p>Let's consider a few obvious impacts caused by the poor design of Linux:</p>
	<ul>
	
	<li>IBM invented the database and SQL concepts. All other databases started from that great design. Imagine SQL queries using regular expressions. Imagine SQL had linux origins where Everything --would --be --unnatural --and --unfriendly. After 50 years, SQL is still the gold standard!</li>
		
	<li>Only IBM z successfully runs more than 100 CPU cores. z16 max is 200 which means only zLinux stands a chance.</li>

	<li>IBM z/OS is designed to conveniently support hundreds of disk drives. While Linux can support the same amount, they typically elect to run fewer really large disks. If the disk transfer rate for 10TB disk is 200MB per second, it would take 50 seconds to read all the data. Considering every 16 CPU core has a 64 lane PCIe 4.0 capable of 128GB per second (16GT/s * 64 lanes / 8 bits per byte), Essentially CPU's will be waiting for data.</li>

	<li>Only DB2 for z/OS can be active in multiple z/OS LPARs at the same time. Even DB2 for zLinux can only run in a single LPAR because you don't have the shared disk concept.</li>
	
	</ul>	
		
<h2>Read no further if you will be insulted by facing the truth <br/>
		Linux screwed up badly from the start with it's poor design philosophy<br/>
		zLinux could easily implement z/OS innovations</h2>

	<p>z/OS system software philosophy: <b>z/OS is about what people don't see.</b></p>

	<p>Linux system software philosophy: You are the master of your universe. As an application software developer, you demand full control so <b>it's up to you as an application software developer to control everything.</b> There are few limitations and restrictions posed upon you.</p>

	<p>Linux is the self proclaimed most advanced OS. It chooses to be everything to everybody. Your cellphone runs android. It's the server of choice. It's the cloud of choice.</p>

	<p>Long ago, they declared Linux as the replacement for all desktops (Windows & Apple). After decades, it's still a miserable failure where Windows & Apple is 90% of the desktop market. Nothing instills confidence like people refusing to use something free.</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z">25 years of zLinux</a> and it still lacks the basic innovations of z/OS</b>. It's sad that mainframe modernization means to accept a lower standard of innovation and excellence.</p>

<h2>Applications software developer versus system software developer<br/>
	There's a reason z/OS software is expensive</h2>

	<p>Linux software developers don't understand the difference. For instance, few realize that <b>relational databases are application software on Linux</b> but system software on z/OS. <b>A cobol programmer could have designed and written (DB2, Oracle, MySQL, ...) for Linux.</b> No self respecting z/OS system software developer (nor their customers) would find these acceptable for z/OS.</p>

	<p>Let me pComparing z/OS with zLinux guarantees all differences are software design choices. I could compare anything While we could compare relational databases, comparing DB2 for z/OS with DB2 for zLinux guarantees the same design choices where possible.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="wyle_e_coyote.webp"></div>

	<p>Bless Linux software developers hearts for demanding to be more than application software developers which is why they refuse to work on z/OS. They don't have the skills to design z/OS system software and they refuse to do application software development on z/OS. Linux developer motto: I can do anything I want and everything is my choice. Security, performance, recovery and everything else are my responsibility. Very little system software exists on Linux.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>You get what you pay for. Not one Linux software developer could design and write DB2 for z/OS. No self respecting z/OS system software developer would find DB2 for Linux an acceptable design for z/OS. DB2 for z/OS and DB2 for linux were designed & written by IBM. Both are supposed to provide the same basic functionality. DB2 for z/OS provides all the features available in DB2 for Linux. The problem with DB2 for Linux is that it's not coupled with  tightly coupled with z/OS using multi-LPAR Sysplex, coupling facility, resmgr, serialization, cross memory, CKD disks and much more. It runs in a state that can destroy the LPAR.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>On the other hand, even an experienced z/OS system software developer would find it difficult to write DB2 for z/OS. It would be impossible for an application software developer. </p>

	<p>IBM left out critical DB2 for z/OS features in Their DB2 for Linux implementation. DB2 for z/OS customers would be livid without these features. I worked on the implementation of SAP High Availability which at that time could not be solved without DB2 for z/OS despite everything else running on Unix / Linux. I haven't looked at it since then but I suspect they now ignore certain problems when not using DB2 for z/OS. Maybe they should call it SAP Mostly High Availability.</p>

	<p>  are far more than ordinary application software developers. They believe they can do anything they want therefore they are system software developers. In some ways, they are because they are responsible for everything (s)</p>

	<p>Consider DB2 for z/OS versus DB2 for Linux. Both developed by IBM and both are supposed to provide the same functionality. It's a fair and easy comparison.</p>
		
	<p>Writing the current implementation of DB2 for Linux would present very little challenge for an ordinary application software developer. TCP sockets, 1 LPAR, FBA disks, parsing and more are simple. While implementing a filesystem may be considered "system", It should not present a challenge and would simplify the implementation.</p>

	<p>IBM is terrible at marketing z/OS and z. </p>

	<p>Linux has duped computer professionals the world over but can't fool the average person about Linux's poor design. The fastest disk drive can read/write around 250MB per second yet a single IBM z/OS LPAR can <b>easily read/write more than 128,000MB per second</b>. To achieve <a href="https://share.confex.com/share/122/webprogram/Handout/Session14772/IMS14772.pdf">100,000 IMS transactions per second</a>, you need a CPU that can keep up with that flood of data. Linux can't dupe the average person where 90% of the desktop/laptop owners are willing to pay for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS.</p>

	<p>Let's jump into the abyss called Unix & Linux. It's official, the computer industry has truly fallen to new lows by embracing extreme mediocrity. Instead of embracing the last remaining truly innovative computer company (IBM), let's move to mediocre because of <b>"motivated reasoning"</b>. I want to believe therefore it must be true despite the actual facts.</p>


	<p>Realize there is nothing that prevents Linux from achieving this standard of excellence except their inability to innovate. Let me point out a small fraction of the genius behind IBM z/OS and IBM z.</p>

	<p>Let's only consider z/OS performance and forget about the IBM pillars of z/OS as advertised to customers (e.g. security, stability, continuous up time, high availability, high volume operations and more). People fail to understand real innovations that only IBM designs and provides through z/OS and IBM z.</p>

<h2>Google proving just because you do a job<br/>
	doesn't mean your good at it</h2>

	<p>Not one of Google's 5,000,000 Unix / Linux servers is IBM z. One IBM z machine could easily replace 512 of their current servers but the problem is the poor design of Linux would force them to run 512 LPAR's.</p> 
		
	<p>Despite spending $Billions, Google did not fix any ugly Linux blemishes that would make it run efficiently on IBM z hardware. Android (linux based), ChromeOS (linux based), Chrome browser, Google earth, Google drives, Waymo self driving car and many more).</p>

	<p>As advertised, Linux can run on any hardware. It can be a server or desktop. It does the Cloud. If only it did these things well, it would be a great OS.</p>

<h2>Mainframe modernization and Pigs can fly<br/>
	Linux is in dire need of modernization</h2>

	<p>For decades, Linux has declared the Linux desktop is the future. As of 2024, MS Windows has 73% of the desktop / laptop market while Linux (including ChromeOS) is 7%. More than 90% of the market is willing to pay Microsoft and Apple instead of using <b>free Linux</b>. Simply put, it's Linux that needs to modernize. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems</a> </p>

	<p>It's easy to deceive computer professionals who are convinced the mainframe needs to be modernized. In reality, z/OS is conforms to the blemishes of Linux. <b>Motivated reasoning</b> has application software developers and the Linux industry falsely but sucksessfully convincing companies that Linux is the future of the server market. No one wants to be an application software developer on z/OS where sysprogs deal with security, performance, file management and more.</p>

<h2>It's been 60 years and other hardware manufacturers haven't fixed basic problems<br/>
	whereas IBM z usually designed it correctly the first time
	</h2>

	<p>I could discuss many instructions but everyone understands the simplicity of Cobol "MOVE A TO B" and C memcpy(A,B).</p>

	<p>IBM z chose wisely by implementing single instruction moves (MVC and MVCL). You only need to know that both are crazy fast compared to other hardware and IBM can improve them at any time without causing customer problems.</p>
		
	<p>All other architectures chose poorly by requiring multiple instructions as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Point to A</li>
		<li>Point to B</li>
		<li>Load data into registers</li>
		<li>Store registers into destination</li>
		<li>Increment pointer to A</li>
		<li>Increment pointer to B</li>
		<li>Repeat at step 3 until all data has been moved</li>
	</ol>

<h2>It's been 60 years and other software developers haven't fixed basic software problems<br/>
	IBM z/OS usually designs it correctly the first time
	</h2>

	<p>IBM z/OS also excels at software. The list is huge on what we could discuss but let's pick something simple as SQL.</p>

	<p>Along with being the first to design database software (both relational & hierarchical) in the 70's, IBM realized customers needed easy access to databases. 50 years later, SQL and databases are still key to the industry.</p>

	<p>Outside of z/OS, userid and password are passed through TCP. SQL injection hacks are unavoidable except in z/OS where you must specifically choose this exposure. GITHUB is a wonderful thing until you forget to remove userids and passwords before storing your code. Send NASA your thanks for occassionally committing this sin.</p>





<h2>Simple look at some CPU's</h2>

	<p>I'll only mention a few very basic details to make this simple. I've chosen The following because they are modern and considered fast. No need to understand this list because it is for reference to be discussed below.</p>

<h2>GHZ (giga-herz has little meaning today</h2>

	<p>Definition of herz means "something" per second. "Something" in the case of a car idling at 600 RPM, it's 10 revolution herz (600 / 60 seconds = 10). In the case of computers, we use the word cycle meaning when can the CPU start the next set of instructions. 1GHZ is 1,000,000,000 cycles per second or 1/1,000,000,000 of a second before the next set of instructions. A set of instruction is where instructions get combined (e.g. move data and branch to an address can be executed at the same time.</p>

	<p>We need to stop using the words Mainframe and supercomputer. They are misnomers because today's Computers are basically the same.</p>
