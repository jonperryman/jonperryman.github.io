<h1>Linux is all hype and no substance!<br/>
	Debunking decades of lies from Linux softwaare engineers</h1>

	<p>By the time you read this to the end, you will conclude that much of what you believe about Linux & C is not reality. Just because they serve a purpose, does not mean they do it well.</p>
	
	<p><b>Motivated reasoning</b>: The need to believe in a lie is so strong that a person will ignore all common sense and real facts.</p>

	<p>It's time to be brutally honest! Linux and C has caused the decay of simple and basic design skills. Look no farther than the decades of debunked lies that persist to this day.</p>

	<p>It's time computer educators (software and hardware) <b>teach the basics that have been lost.</b> It's time they open their students eyes to the lies that have convinced them they are exceptional compared to the <b>dinosaur IBM mainframe.</b></p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="img/lemmings.gif"></div>

<h2>Linux and C are Broken As Designed (BAD)!</h2>

	<p>This is the one thing software engineers can never admit. This list is about the lies you must tell yourself because you need Linux to be the greatest OS ever and C the greatest programming language. This is about the lies you need to justify your hatred for the mainframe when the reality is its decades ahead of every other computer architecture and operating system.</p>

	<p>After reviewing this list of debunked Linux Lies, <b>name 1 design that Linux and C software engineers designed correctly!</b> While their designs solve a problem, they introduce new problems. The real question is how anyone considers these great designs.</p>

	<p>Despising the mainframe, while popular, is not a valid reason to ignore Linux and C failures. There are a lot of failuress that are being ignored.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="img/lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

<h2>Dumbing down to the computer basics because of Linux & C<br/>
	Even Google engineers don't truly understand the basics of computing</h2>
	
	<p>Understanding of the most basic and most important computer skills has been lost because of the decline of the IBM mainframe. Since software engineers (falsely) believe they understand servers, let's start with "servers".</p>

<hr/><h2>Software engineers no longer understand "servers"</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL</b>, Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>I asked ChatGpt for the <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/modern_definition_server.html');">"modern definition of a server"</span>. <b>ROTFLOL</b>, software engineers can no longer concieve of a server that is not <b>"internet"</b> based. Additionally virtualization (virtual machines) plays an extremely important role in the Linux server concept. These are 2 of several concepts that cause Linux to perform so badly.</p>
	
<h2>How can 2 servers working together<br/>
	not be distributed yet 64 miles apart?</h2>

	<p>I wanted to read something insanely stupid, so I asked ChatGpt: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/modern_definition_server.html');">is the mainframe a distributed computer?"</span> which as expected replied emphatically <b>"NO"</b>. <b>ROTFLOL</b>, ChatGPT knows this is a lie because when I asked ChatGPT: <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('chatgpt/max_distance_between_mainframes.html');">"what is the maximum distance between mainframes?"</span>.</p>

	<p>How can 2 mainframes be upto 64 miles apart and not be distributed at the same time? It also says that using Linux server concepts (called loosely coupled), have no distance restrictions. Think again if you believe that non-mainframe servers cannot be tightly coupled. <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a> is actually a tightly coupled blade server farm (43,808 servers) running CrayOS.</p>

<h2>IBM designing great server technology since 1965<br/>

		need to understand that their knowledge & expertise is limited to Linux. say they understand but clearly they don't. This page is about educating Linux & Unix software engineers whose limited understanding of software designs has them falsely believing lies. For far too long, IBM has described the mainframe capabilities that software engineers don't comprehend.</p>
	
<hr/><H2>Lie 1: Mainframes & Supercomputers are specialized computers<br/>
	while Linux computers are great at generalized computing</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>There is very little difference between any of these computers. It has been proven that any operating system is capable of running on most computers. Other than an IBM License, any of the IBM mainframe operating systems will run happily but with degraded performance on any of these computers.</p>  

<h2>The largest supercomputer is actually a server farm</h2>

	<p>The El Capitan Supercomputer <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a> is actually a server farm consisting of 43,808 blade servers each containing 2 AMD x86 CPU's and 1 AMD GPU. Google could replace their 5,000,000 servers (& GPUs) with 114 El Capitan supercomputers.</p>

<h2>A quarter century<br/>
	Linux running on IBM mainframe computers<br/>
	IBM mainframe operating systems running on non-mainframe computers</h2>

	<p>How many more decades before people learn that "mainframe" has never had a definable meaning? IBM operating systems happily run on other computers without any special hardware. Linux happily runs on IBM mainframe hardware. Just because this occurred in 2000, does not mean it couldn't have occurred with the first PC. It simply means there was no demand!</p>

	<p>The mainframe (both hardware & software) is not specialized as Linux software engineers claim and has always been fully capable of doing everything peformed by Linux. These capabilities did not exist because there wasn't sufficient demand. Linux costing $0 running on cheap computers is great motivation to ignore the mainframe.</p>

<h2>Lie #1 summary: no real difference in capabilities</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Mainframe and supercomputer are meaningless words.</li>
	<li>El Capitan supercomputer proves Linux has the capacity to equal the IBM mainframe but sadly lacks the skills to follow through.</li>
	<li>Desktops and laptops are dominated by Microsoft and Apple. Despite Linux and ChromeOS (Google Linux) being free, after decades they failed achieve their goal of becoming the dominant desktop.</li>
	<li>IBM mainframe ignored desktops and laptops. They didn't waant to fail like Linux and ChromeOS.</li>

<H2>Lie #1: Linux software engineers understand "<b>distributed computing</b>"<br/>
	Linux: the stingy kid syndrome</H2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>

	<p>How many attempts will it take before Linux gets "distributed computing" right? Technically client / server is a form of distributed computing which is the basis for all Linux distributed computing. Why does Linux / Unix keep inventing another new form of "distributed computing"?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>kubernetes</li>
		<li>Cloud</li>
		<li>distributed database</li>
		<li>Hadoop</li>
		<li>microservices</li>
		<li>publisher / subscriber</li>
		<li>grid computing</li>
		<li>NAS & NFS</li>
		<li>consumer / supplier</li>
		<li>and more</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The problem is Linux is not designed to share. It suffers from "stingy kid syndrome" that will not share it's toys with anyone. For example, the El Capitan supercomputer has 48,000 disk drives and 48,000 GPUs wired directly to each of it's 48,000 servers.</p>

	<p>Mainframes do not own any disk drives. You could buy 1 disk drive and share it among 10 mainframes. The mainframe is designed to share as much as possible. It's doubtful anyone would spend millions $ on 10 mainframes and skimp on disk drives but possibility still exists.</p>

	<p>Also note that IBM recently partnered with NVIDIA to improve IBM's AI capabilities. If this is for the mainframe, this can only mean 1 thing, that IBM plans to share GPU's among multiple mainframes in the same way it shares disk drives. In theory, mainframe customers will be able to buy as many GPU's that are needed (1, 100, 1,000 or ...). <a>https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-03-18-ibm-taps-nvidia-ai-data-platform-technologies-to-accelerate-ai-at-scale</a></p>

<h1>Line #2: distributed database</h1>

	<p>ROTFLOL! This is why large banks and stock exchanges are still using mainframes. Occassional database errors are unacceptable. On the other hand, Google's YouTube finds the occassional subscription list error is acceptable.</p>

	<p>For your benefit, I asked X AI GROK <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div('grok_databases_how_they_work');">"How does a distributed database work?"</span>. </p>

	<p>El Capitan is a server farm with very little difference to Google's 5,000,000 servers. I'm guessing the last supercomputer died with the Cray 3 (see <a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-3	</a>).</p>
	
<H2>Lie 2: Linux software developers understand "distributed computing"

	<p><span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(telum_grok);">I asked X's GROK AI "what is Google's ranking in Innovation. As expected, Google's software development influence is colossal.</span> As an industry leader in software developement, how have they allowed these lies to remain so popular. Where are the fact checkers!</p>

<br/><hr/><h2>Lie #1: Google's computers are nothing like<br/> 
	specialized Supercomputers and specialized IBM's mainframes</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL</b>, Rolling On The Floor Laughing Out Loud!</p>
	<p>The only real difference between todays computers is $$$$. Supercomputers and mainframes are no longer relevant words. Both are fully capable of any task performed by any other computer.</p>

<h2>El Capitan supercomputer is 43,808 X86 Blade servers<br/>
	most likely running Linux</h2>

	<a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Capitan_(supercomputer)</a>

	<p>These blade servers are no different than Google's 5,000,000 servers. Each of the 43,808 El Capitan blade servers has 2 z86 CPUs and 1 GPU (graphics card) making them essentially the same as a Google server. Housing them in a box instead of a room does not change they are the same type of server. Both most likely run some type of Linux. Both are server farms./p>

	<p>I'm guessing that Google could replace it's 5,000,000 server with 60 El Capitan supercomputers. Since Google & HPE won't disclose their stats, we are left to speculate but El Capitan's 12,000 Gbps data transfer speed versus Google most likely using 1 Gbps internet routers indicates El Capitan potentially handles 12,000 times the data between its servers.</p>
	
	<p>Why doesn't Google buy El Capitan supercomputers that can handle the data. While $600 million seems staggering, it's only $26,000 per server in El Capitan. I'm guessing that Google is spending a similar amount for each of it's servers</p>

<h2>Google has <b>0</b> IBM mainframe computers, proving you can't fix stupid<br/>
	Worse yet, companies want to move away from their IBM mainframes</h2>

	While an IBM mainframes 1,000 Gbps data speed is much slower than El Capitan, it is still 1,000 times faster than a Google server running internet router at 1 Gbps. Also realize that a Google server CPU could not process the data at these speeds. While El Capitan has faster data speeds, don't forget it ships most of that data to a GPU (graphics card) meaning the CPU is not processing most of the data. It's being used as an I/O device for the GPU.</p>

	<p>Linux has been available on the IBM mainframe for a quarter century. It boggles the mind that Google does not run any IBM mainframes that are hundreds of times faster than Googles current servers. Google could eliminate a most of their database replication by replacing hundreds of the same replicated database server with a couple of IBM mainframes.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="bless_your_heart.jpg" width="400px"></div>	
		
<h2>Will Quantum computers be a business reality in our lifetime?</h2>

	<p>Google estimates their quantum computer is "47 years faster than the fastest supercomputer". <a>https://www.sciencealert.com/google-quantum-computer-is-47-years-faster-than-1-supercomputer</a></p>
		
	<p>If the El Capitan supercomputer requires 43,808 servers, will a quantum computer require billions of servers to supply it with business data?</p>
	
	<p>My guess is that quantum computers will be relegated to non-data intensive applications like password hacking. Most likely they will be of very limited use in business applications.</p>

<hr/><h2>Lie #2: The mainframe is capable of processing more data than a Google server</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> This is a Google design <b>choice</b>. <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(grok_z16_performance);">I asked the GROK about the IBM mainframe CPU (Telum) performance?". Grok mentions "high-volume transactional workloads" which in simple terms are things like banks handling the trading of stocks. IBM boast</span>
		
		El Capitan proves that  </p>




<p>While IBM mainframes communicate using PCIe 4.0 (approximately 1024 Gbps) which is 12 times slower than than El Capitan's 12 Gbps, it's still 1,000 times faster than Google's router's 1Gbps. Let's not forget that IBM estimates their largest mainframe is the equivalent of 2,000 X86 cores (100 20-core CPUs) when running Linux.</p>

<p>Google knows Linux is a 1 server world where the need to expand the same data to a second (or more) server complicates everything. If Google's philosphy is replication of the data, then they are wasting time when 1 IBM mainframe running Linux would not need replication until the 100th server is needed and more important, the data replication will be 1,000 times faster.</p>

<h2>shared disks</h2>






<h1>Linux software developers still believe all the lies
	<br/>Understanding Google's lack of basic computer skills</h1>

	<p>Like Google, you still believe decades of lies about the mainframe. In particular, you incorrectly believe it's an obsolete dinosaur. You incorrectly believe Google is a successful computer company because of their computer expertise but sadly you ignore that they don't understand most simple basic computer concepts. Not 1 IBM mainframe at Google despite 5,000,000 servers, 182,000 employees and tons of software they designed and wrote (e.g. Android, ChromeOS, Go, Chrome browser, Waymo and much more).</p>

	<h2>It's time to be brutally honest with yourself<br/>Answering why the mainframe still exist</h2>

	<p>My focus here are the <b>facts</b> about Linux features that Linux software developers incorrectly believe, makes Linux an outstanding success. Since you'll never understand the mainframe features, let's forget about discussing mainframe features and instead, focus on the design failures of C and Linux.</p>

	<p>Linux has been available on the mainframe for the last 25 years, so <span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(telum_grok);">I asked the X GROK AI, "Is the IBM Telum the fastest CPU?".</span> The Answer was horrifying. A quarter century of Linux on the mainframe and computer professionals still believe the same lies they used to justify their expertise in the past.</p>

	<p><span class="fake_anchor" onclick="mf.open_scrollable_div(telum_grok);">GROK boasted about wonderful mainframe features (E.g. 100,000 transactions per second)</span> but failed to mention that Linux on the mainframe doesn't provide those same features despite being on the same hardware.</p>
	
	<p>On the mainframe, Linux and C are Broken As Designed (BAD). IBM RedHat Linux is now closed source which begs the question, will they fix Linux for the mainframe. It's time to stop putting lipstick on this pig and see the blemishes. It's time for computer professors to teach real computer fundamentals.</p>

	<p>If you can't create simple designs correctly, why do they believe they can successfully create sophisticated designs correctly?  Motivated reasoning has the computer industry ignoring real facts that they are not experts as they believe.</p>

	<br/><hr/><h2>LIE: Google utilizes Linux because it's a great design<br/>
			How are they not completely embarrassed by their design skills?</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL</b> (Rolling On The Floor, Laughing Out Loud)! Google uses Linux because it's free, not because of it's design. They spent $millions building Android and ChromeOS from Linux why they ignore major Linux design errors.</p>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b> When you can move a database to an NAS (network disk drive) and have 2 or more database servers updating that database disk, you will finally understand "distributed computing". Google with it's 5,000,000 servers is still limited to 1 database server using 1 database disk drive.</p>
	
	<div class="center-container"><img src="bless_your_heart.jpg" width="400px"></div>
	
	<p>Since 1964 (60 years), IBM DB2 has supported multiple database servers using a shared database disk. When another database server is needed, then you simply add another mainframe computer connected to the same database disks. With Google's extensive knowledge of Linux, why are they still in the dark ages of computing with their 5,000,000 servers?</p>

	<p>Linux mentality has created an endless list of crappy "distributed computing" solutions that fail to deliver on their promises (e.g. kubernetes, "The Cloud", microservices, pub/sub, grid, NFS, consumer & suppliers and too many more to list here). Surely another will be coming next week. How many more attempts will it take for Linux to solve the "Distributed computing" problem?</p>

	<p>35 years ago, the IBM mainframe created "Sysplex" to solve the "distributed computing" problem. A single well designed solution which Linux could have implemented but instead, chooses crappy solutions that never fully solve the problem.</p>

	<p>While you say Linux solutions exist on the mainframe, remember they exist solely for Linux "distributed computing" which lack Sysplex features.</p>

	<h2>IRS mainframe modernization 
		<br/>implementing Linux "Distributed computing" concepts</h2>

	<p><b>ROTFLOL!</b>The IRS is currently "modernizing" their mainframe using JAVA and the Linux "distributed computing" database solution (JDBC) instead of Sysplex. JAVA was designed using Linux / Unix concepts which is why IBM discounts computers for customers using JAVA. They expect to sell more mainframes to those customers to offset the discount. They also realize these applications will remain on the mainframe (or mainframe for Linux) because moving to x86 will most likelyy require a re-write.</p>

	<h2>Understanding why the IRS will fail
		<br/>because of non-mainframe "distributed computing" databases</h2>

	<p>In Linux, database disks cannot be used by 2 different database servers at the same time otherwise they will be destroyed. Once the database server becomes too busy, you are forced into creative solutions.</p>

	<p>On the other hand because of Sysplex, mainframe database servers can run several database servers using the same database disks. If you ran 10 mainframe's serving the same database and assuming IBM is correct that each is the equivalent of 2,000 x86 cpu cores, then that would be 20,000 x86 cores or 1,000 x86 servers.</p>
	
	<div class="center-container"><img src="lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

	<hr><h2>Lie #2: Developers on Linux can easily use "distributed computing"</h2>
	
	<p>ROTFLOL! On the mainframe, there is no training (or discussion) for "distristributed computing". It's like breathing because because every program you write is 'distibuted computing'. It's only when Linux is involved that you must be taught that skill.</p>

	<p>Just because Linux does a job doesn't mean it does it well. Nothing rings more true about Linux and it's advocates than this. For decades, Linux touted it is the future of desktops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">Microsoft Windows and Apple proved them wrong with 90% of today's market share</a> <b>despite Linux desktop being free! It clearly doesn't do desktops well.</b> </p>

	<p>If, for z/OS, you ignore $$$$ and that Linux application programmers demand to be the masters of their domain, the simple basic facts show IBM z/OS is by far the best server. For example, Linux still does not have the basic concept of serialized shared files. The functionality is part of application programmers domain which is why Linux is popular.</p>

	<p>There is nothing preventing Linux from implementing every z/OS innovation. Pray that IBM going closed source with Redhat signals they are <b>integrating z/OS innovations into Linux for IBM Z</b>.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="lipstick_on_a_pig.jpg"></div>

	<p>You can put lipstick on this pig but at the end of the day, Linux is still a pig. Microsoft and Apple proved this pig isn't suitable as a desktop even when it's free! </p>
	
	<p>It's time to put this beauty queen into competition with z/OS. Let's consider a few obvious impacts caused by the poor design of Linux:</p>

	<p>Cheryl's job <b>wasn't</b> to tell you to buy a faster Ferrari. Her job was to make your existing Ferrari run faster and she knew how to make it scream.</p>

	<p>Using Cheryl's z/OS insights, Linux software design failures become painfully obvious. z/OS performance basics are relevant to Linux although they are extremely difficult to apply to Linux because of it's current implementation. z/OS and Linux for IBM Z both run on IBM System Z hardware and All failures lie within improper software design.</p>

<h2>Linux developers are the master of their domain<br/>
	Sysprogs are vital to every z/OS shop</h2>

	<p>All z/OS shops have sysprogs (performance, security, dasd, IMS, CICS and more). These positions rarely exist in Linux shops. More often, every Linux developer is tasked with all these duties.</p>

	<p>While </p>

<h2>Google has 5,000,000 Linux servers<br/>
	None are Linux for IBM Z</h2>

	<p>For decades, we've been deceived into believing Linux is an efficient OS. Linux for IBM Z proves <b>Linux is poorly designed and inefficient</b>. It runs faster but is not worth the extra $$$$.</p>

	<p>We know IBM Z is many times faster than any other server on the market because a single LPAR can run <a href="https://share.confex.com/share/122/webprogram/Handout/Session14772/IMS14772.pdf">more than 100,000 IMS transactions per second</a>.</p>

	<p>This also demonstrates that the software innovations designed into z/OS are many times more efficient than Linux.</p>

	<p>After so many decades, Linux and Unix continue to deceive the computer industry about IBM mainframes! Anyone thinking that</p>
	
	<p>They could not deceive the public by their demands of replacing Microsoft Windows and Apple. That's embarrassing. 90% of the public knows you get what you pay for and they refuse to embrace Linux desktop despite it being free.</p>


	<h2>Linux doesn't stand up to well designed software</h2>

	<p>It comes down to $$$$. The cheapest IBM LinuxOne is half the price of an IBM Z, despite being essentially the same computer. Linux for IBM Z could easily be designed to perform as well as z/OS but does not perform anywhere as well as z/OS, thus the need to make LinuxOne so cheap.</p>

	<p>The failure of Linux in the desktop market should not instill confidence. Linux is a jack of all trades but master of none. Comparisons are based on Linux's ability to do everything instead of how well it does each task. It does desktop but it does not do it well.</p>

	<p>After 25 years of Linux for IBM Z, we still ignore fair and honest comparisons with simple yet obvious design flaws. z/OS obviously can't run on x86, RISCV nor any other non-IBM Z computers</p>



	<h2>The public won't be duped by false Linux advertising<br/> 
		Linux failed for decades saying the most advanced OS (Linux) will replace all desktops

		<p>How is it that computer people are so gullible to believe in the grandeur of Linux when the public can't be duped? Decades of being told the desktop from the greatest OS (Linux & Unix) will replace all desktops. Decades later, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">90% are willing to pay for Microsoft Windows and Apple (Mac, Macbook, iMac and ...)</a> instead of moving to the free Linux desktop.</p>

	<p>You can put lipstick on this pig but at the end of the day, it's still a pig. Microsoft and Apple proved this pig isn't suitable as a desktop even when it's free!</p>
	
	<p>Let's put this beauty queen in competition with z/OS. Let's even put IBM z/OS at a great disadvantage by comparing DB2 for z/OS to any transactional database available for Linux running on any type of hardware including DB2 for zLinux.</p>

	<p>Let's consider a few obvious impacts caused by the poor design of Linux:</p>
	<ul>
	
	<li>IBM invented the database and SQL concepts. All other databases started from that great design. Imagine SQL queries using regular expressions. Imagine SQL had linux origins where Everything --would --be --unnatural --and --unfriendly. After 50 years, SQL is still the gold standard!</li>
		
	<li>Only IBM z successfully runs more than 100 CPU cores. z16 max is 200 which means only zLinux stands a chance.</li>

	<li>IBM z/OS is designed to conveniently support hundreds of disk drives. While Linux can support the same amount, they typically elect to run fewer really large disks. If the disk transfer rate for 10TB disk is 200MB per second, it would take 50 seconds to read all the data. Considering every 16 CPU core has a 64 lane PCIe 4.0 capable of 128GB per second (16GT/s * 64 lanes / 8 bits per byte), Essentially CPU's will be waiting for data.</li>

	<li>Only DB2 for z/OS can be active in multiple z/OS LPARs at the same time. Even DB2 for zLinux can only run in a single LPAR because you don't have the shared disk concept.</li>
	
	</ul>	
		
<h2>Read no further if you will be insulted by facing the truth <br/>
		Linux screwed up badly from the start with it's poor design philosophy<br/>
		zLinux could easily implement z/OS innovations</h2>

	<p>z/OS system software philosophy: <b>z/OS is about what people don't see.</b></p>

	<p>Linux system software philosophy: You are the master of your universe. As an application software developer, you demand full control so <b>it's up to you as an application software developer to control everything.</b> There are few limitations and restrictions posed upon you.</p>

	<p>Linux is the self proclaimed most advanced OS. It chooses to be everything to everybody. Your cellphone runs android. It's the server of choice. It's the cloud of choice.</p>

	<p>Long ago, they declared Linux as the replacement for all desktops (Windows & Apple). After decades, it's still a miserable failure where Windows & Apple is 90% of the desktop market. Nothing instills confidence like people refusing to use something free.</p>

	<p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_on_IBM_Z">25 years of zLinux</a> and it still lacks the basic innovations of z/OS</b>. It's sad that mainframe modernization means to accept a lower standard of innovation and excellence.</p>

<h2>Applications software developer versus system software developer<br/>
	There's a reason z/OS software is expensive</h2>

	<p>Linux software developers don't understand the difference. For instance, few realize that <b>relational databases are application software on Linux</b> but system software on z/OS. <b>A cobol programmer could have designed and written (DB2, Oracle, MySQL, ...) for Linux.</b> No self respecting z/OS system software developer (nor their customers) would find these acceptable for z/OS.</p>

	<p>Let me pComparing z/OS with zLinux guarantees all differences are software design choices. I could compare anything While we could compare relational databases, comparing DB2 for z/OS with DB2 for zLinux guarantees the same design choices where possible.</p>

	<div class="center-container"><img src="wyle_e_coyote.webp"></div>

	<p>Bless Linux software developers hearts for demanding to be more than application software developers which is why they refuse to work on z/OS. They don't have the skills to design z/OS system software and they refuse to do application software development on z/OS. Linux developer motto: I can do anything I want and everything is my choice. Security, performance, recovery and everything else are my responsibility. Very little system software exists on Linux.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>You get what you pay for. Not one Linux software developer could design and write DB2 for z/OS. No self respecting z/OS system software developer would find DB2 for Linux an acceptable design for z/OS. DB2 for z/OS and DB2 for linux were designed & written by IBM. Both are supposed to provide the same basic functionality. DB2 for z/OS provides all the features available in DB2 for Linux. The problem with DB2 for Linux is that it's not coupled with  tightly coupled with z/OS using multi-LPAR Sysplex, coupling facility, resmgr, serialization, cross memory, CKD disks and much more. It runs in a state that can destroy the LPAR.</p>

	<p></p>

	<p>On the other hand, even an experienced z/OS system software developer would find it difficult to write DB2 for z/OS. It would be impossible for an application software developer. </p>

	<p>IBM left out critical DB2 for z/OS features in Their DB2 for Linux implementation. DB2 for z/OS customers would be livid without these features. I worked on the implementation of SAP High Availability which at that time could not be solved without DB2 for z/OS despite everything else running on Unix / Linux. I haven't looked at it since then but I suspect they now ignore certain problems when not using DB2 for z/OS. Maybe they should call it SAP Mostly High Availability.</p> 

	<p>A cobol programmer ha</p>

	<p>  are far more than ordinary application software developers. They believe they can do anything they want therefore they are system software developers. In some ways, they are because they are responsible for everything (s)</p>

	<p>Consider DB2 for z/OS versus DB2 for Linux. Both developed by IBM and both are supposed to provide the same functionality. It's a fair and easy comparison.</p>
		
	<p>Writing the current implementation of DB2 for Linux would present very little challenge for an ordinary application software developer. TCP sockets, 1 LPAR, FBA disks, parsing and more are simple. While implementing a filesystem may be considered "system", It should not present a challenge and would simplify the implementation.</p>



<h2></h2>

	<p>IBM is terrible at marketing z/OS and z. </p>

	<p>Linux has duped computer professionals the world over but can't fool the average person about Linux's poor design. The fastest disk drive can read/write around 250MB per second yet a single IBM z/OS LPAR can <b>easily read/write more than 128,000MB per second</b>. To achieve <a href="https://share.confex.com/share/122/webprogram/Handout/Session14772/IMS14772.pdf">100,000 IMS transactions per second</a>, you need a CPU that can keep up with that flood of data. Linux can't dupe the average person where 90% of the desktop/laptop owners are willing to pay for Microsoft Windows and Apple OS.</p>

	<p>Let's jump into the abyss called Unix & Linux. It's official, the computer industry has truly fallen to new lows by embracing extreme mediocrity. Instead of embracing the last remaining truly innovative computer company (IBM), let's move to mediocre because of <b>"motivated reasoning"</b>. I want to believe therefore it must be true despite the actual facts.</p>


	<p>Realize there is nothing that prevents Linux from achieving this standard of excellence except their inability to innovate. Let me point out a small fraction of the genius behind IBM z/OS and IBM z.</p>

	<p>Let's only consider z/OS performance and forget about the IBM pillars of z/OS as advertised to customers (e.g. security, stability, continuous up time, high availability, high volume operations and more). People fail to understand real innovations that only IBM designs and provides through z/OS and IBM z.</p>

<h2>Google proving just because you do a job<br/>
	doesn't mean your good at it</h2>

	<p>Not one of Google's 5,000,000 Unix / Linux servers is IBM z. One IBM z machine could easily replace 512 of their current servers but the problem is the poor design of Linux would force them to run 512 LPAR's.</p> 
		
	<p>Despite spending $Billions, Google did not fix any ugly Linux blemishes that would make it run efficiently on IBM z hardware. Android (linux based), ChromeOS (linux based), Chrome browser, Google earth, Google drives, Waymo self driving car and many more).</p>

	<p>As advertised, Linux can run on any hardware. It can be a server or desktop. It does the Cloud. If only it did these things well, it would be a great OS.</p>

<h2>Mainframe modernization and Pigs can fly<br/>
	Linux is in dire need of modernization</h2>

	<p>For decades, Linux has declared the Linux desktop is the future. As of 2024, MS Windows has 73% of the desktop / laptop market while Linux (including ChromeOS) is 7%. More than 90% of the market is willing to pay Microsoft and Apple instead of using <b>free Linux</b>. Simply put, it's Linux that needs to modernize. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems</a> </p>

	<p>It's easy to deceive computer professionals who are convinced the mainframe needs to be modernized. In reality, z/OS is conforms to the blemishes of Linux. <b>Motivated reasoning</b> has application software developers and the Linux industry falsely but sucksessfully convincing companies that Linux is the future of the server market. No one wants to be an application software developer on z/OS where sysprogs deal with security, performance, file management and more.</p>

<h2>It's been 60 years and other hardware manufacturers haven't fixed basic problems<br/>
	whereas IBM z usually designed it correctly the first time
	</h2>

	<p>I could discuss many instructions but everyone understands the simplicity of Cobol "MOVE A TO B" and C memcpy(A,B).</p>

	<p>IBM z chose wisely by implementing single instruction moves (MVC and MVCL). You only need to know that both are crazy fast compared to other hardware and IBM can improve them at any time without causing customer problems.</p>
		
	<p>All other architectures chose poorly by requiring multiple instructions as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Point to A</li>
		<li>Point to B</li>
		<li>Load data into registers</li>
		<li>Store registers into destination</li>
		<li>Increment pointer to A</li>
		<li>Increment pointer to B</li>
		<li>Repeat at step 3 until all data has been moved</li>
	</ol>

<h2>It's been 60 years and other software developers haven't fixed basic software problems<br/>
	IBM z/OS usually designs it correctly the first time
	</h2>

	<p>IBM z/OS also excels at software. The list is huge on what we could discuss but let's pick something simple as SQL.</p>

	<p>Along with being the first to design database software (both relational & hierarchical) in the 70's, IBM realized customers needed easy access to databases. 50 years later, SQL and databases are still key to the industry.</p>

	<p>Outside of z/OS, userid and password are passed through TCP. SQL injection hacks are unavoidable except in z/OS where you must specifically choose this exposure. GITHUB is a wonderful thing until you forget to remove userids and passwords before storing your code. Send NASA your thanks for occassionally committing this sin.</p>

In the case of computers, we use the word cycle meaning when can the CPU start the next set of instructions. 1GHZ is 1,000,000,000 cycles per second or 1/1,000,000,000 of a second before the next set of instructions. A set of instruction is where instructions get combined (e.g. move data and branch to an address can be executed at the same time.</p>
