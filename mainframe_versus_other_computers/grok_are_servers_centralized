Servers are not inherently centralized; their centralization depends on the system architecture and deployment. Unlike mainframes, which are designed as centralized computing systems, servers can operate in various configurations:
Centralized: A single server or a small cluster in one location (e.g., a data center) can handle all computing tasks, similar to a mainframe. For example, a company might use one server for its database or application hosting, accessed by clients remotely.

Distributed: Servers can be spread across multiple locations, working together in a network (e.g., cloud computing, content delivery networks, or microservices architectures). This is common in modern setups like AWS, Google Cloud, or edge computing, where servers are geographically dispersed to reduce latency or improve redundancy.

Hybrid: Many organizations use a mix, with some centralized servers for critical tasks (e.g., a main database) and distributed servers for other functions (e.g., web hosting or load balancing).

In the 1970s, servers as we know them today were less common, and computing was dominated by centralized mainframes. By the 1980s and 1990s, client-server models emerged, enabling more distributed setups, though centralized server setups remained prevalent for specific applications.
