<h1>I asked GROK about the IBM Telum CPU performance</h1>

<p>The IBM z16, powered by the Telum processor, features an integrated on-chip AI accelerator designed to handle real-time AI inferencing at scale, particularly for high-volume transactional workloads like fraud detection in financial systems. IBM has stated that the z16 with z/OS achieves a "20x response time improvement with 19x higher throughput" when performing AI inferencing compared to a "comparable x86 cloud server with 60ms average network latency." This comparison highlights the z16's ability to process AI tasks on-chip, avoiding the latency introduced by moving data across a network to an external AI appliance or server, as is common in many x86-based systems.</p>

<p>However, this 20x figure is not a universal measure of the z16’s performance. It applies specifically to AI inferencing workloads under optimal conditions on the z16, compared to a baseline x86 server configuration with added network latency. For general-purpose computing tasks—such as traditional batch processing, database operations, or non-AI workloads—the z16’s performance advantage over other systems, including x86 servers or other mainframes, would vary significantly and likely not reach a 20x improvement. The z16’s Telum processor runs at 5.2 GHz with 8 cores per chip (up to 200 configurable cores in a maxed-out system), but raw clock speed or core count alone doesn’t make it inherently 20 times faster than, say, a modern Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC processor, which can have higher core counts and different architectural strengths.</p>

<p>Comparisons to other computers also depend on the specific systems in question. For instance, high-end x86 servers (e.g., those with Intel Sapphire Rapids or AMD Genoa CPUs) can deliver exceptional performance in parallelized workloads, often exceeding the z16 in raw compute throughput for certain tasks. Similarly, other mainframe systems like the IBM z15 or even non-IBM architectures might not show a 20x gap, as their performance deltas are more incremental.</p>

<p>The z16’s real advantage lies in its specialized design: low-latency AI inferencing, quantum-safe cryptography, and extreme reliability for mission-critical workloads. For example, it can handle up to 300 billion inference requests per day with 1ms latency, a feat tailored to its architecture and not directly comparable to general-purpose computers. Energy efficiency is another factor—IBM claims the z16 uses 50% less energy than x86 systems for equivalent workloads—but this doesn’t equate to speed.</p>

<p>In summary, the IBM z16 isn’t "20 times faster than other computers" in a broad sense. That claim is tied to a narrow, optimized use case—AI inferencing with z/OS versus a networked x86 server. For other tasks or against other systems, its performance edge would be less pronounced, and in some cases, modern x86 or alternative architectures might outperform it depending on the workload. The z16 excels in its niche, but it’s not a universal 20x speed champion.</p>
