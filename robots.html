I design exceptional solutions which includes the development of 
telepresence robots for the Tech Museum. The following video shows
spidy (hexapod robot) movements.

* Any modern web browser (Windows, Linux, Mac or Android)</br> 
* Tablets work well because they have a touch screen and small size</br>
* Video in middle when camera is attached<br>
* The forward and backward buttons are slide bars.</br>

New robots can be quickly and easily added.

Designing a complete computer based hexapod is outside the skillset of most developers.
You must deal with several components. That was the case for the Tech Museum. 
I have such a broad range of experience, it was not difficult. I based it off a Raspberry Pi 2B
and required setup of several products (e.g. wifi access point). 
Programs written in HTML, javascript, C++, python 3 and PHP.
